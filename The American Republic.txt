PREFACE.


In the volume which, with much diffidence, is here offered to the  public, I have given, as far as I have considered it worth giving,  my whole thought in a connected form on the nature, necessity,  extent, authority, origin, ground, and constitution of government,  and the unity, nationality, constitution, tendencies, and destiny  of the American Republic.  Many of the points treated have been  from time to time discussed or touched upon, and many of the views  have been presented, in my previous writings; but this work is  newly and independently written from beginning to end, and is as  complete on the topics treated as I have been able to make it.

I have taken nothing bodily from my previous essays, but I have  used their thoughts as far as I have judged them sound and they  came within the scope of my present work.  I have not felt myself  bound to adhere to my own past thoughts or expressions any farther  than they coincide with my present convictions, and I have written  as freely and as independently as if I had never  viii                                                  written or  published any thing before.  I have never been the slave of my  own past, and truth has always been dearer to me than my own  opinions.  This work is not only my latest, but will be my last  on politics or government, and must be taken as the authentic,  and the only authentic statement of my political views and  convictions, and whatever in any of my previous writings conflicts  with the principles defended in its pages, must be regarded as  retracted, and rejected.

The work now produced is based on scientific principles; but it is  an essay rather than a scientific treatise, and even good-natured  critics will, no doubt, pronounce it an article or a series of  articles designed for a review, rather than a book.  It is hard to  overcome the habits of a lifetime.  I have taken some pains to  exchange the reviewer for the author, but am fully conscious that  I have not succeeded.  My work can lay claim to very little  artistic merit.  It is full of repetitions; the same thought is  frequently recurring,--the result, to some extent, no doubt, of  carelessness and the want of artistic skill; but to a greater  extent, I fear, of "malice aforethought."  In composing my work I  have followed, rather than directed, the course of my thought,  and, having very little confidence in the memory or industry of  readers, I have preferred, when the completeness  ix                                                  of the argument  required it, to repeat myself to encumbering my pages with  perpetual references to what has gone before.

That I attach some value to this work is evident from my consenting  to its publication; but how much or how little of it is really  mine, I am quite unable to say.  I have, from my youth up, been  reading, observing, thinking, reflecting, talking, I had almost  said writing, at least by fits and starts, on political subjects,  especially in their connection with philosophy, theology, history,  and social progress, and have assimilated to my own mind what it  would assimilate, without keeping any notes of the sources whence  the materials assimilated were derived.  I have written freely  from my own mind as I find it now formed; but how it has been so  formed, or whence I have borrowed, my readers know as well as I.   All that is valuable in the thoughts set forth, it is safe to assume  has been appropriated from others.  Where I have been distinctly  conscious of borrowing what has not become common property, I have  given credit, or, at least, mentioned the author's name, with three  important exceptions which I wish to note more formally.

I am principally indebted for the view of the American nationality  and the Federal Constitution I present, to hints and suggestions  furnished x           by the remarkable work of John C. Hurd, Esq., on The Law of  Freedom and Bondage in the United States, a work of rare learning  and profound philosophic views.  I could not have written my work  without the aid derived from its suggestions, any more than I  could without Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas,  Suarez, Pierre Leroux, and the Abbate Gioberti.  To these two  last-named authors, one a humanitarian sophist, the other a  Catholic priest, and certainly one of the profoundest  philosophical writers of this century, I am much indebted, though  I have followed the political system of neither.  I have taken  from Leroux the germs of the doctrine I set forth on the solidarity  of the race, and from Gioberti the doctrine I defend in relation  to the creative act, which is, after all, simply that of the  Credo and the first verse of Genesis.

In treating the several questions which the preparation of this  volume has brought up, in their connection, and in the light of  first principles, I have changed or modified, on more than one  important point, the views I had expressed in my previous  writings, especially on the distinction between civilized and  barbaric nations, the real basis of civilization itself, and the  value to the world of the Graeco-Roman civilization.  I have  ranked feudalism under the head of barbarism, xi                                               rejected every  species of political aristocracy, and represented the English  constitution as essentially antagonistic to the American, not as  its type.  I have accepted universal suffrage in principle, and  defended American democracy, which I define to be territorial  democracy, and carefully distinguish from pure individualism on  the one hand, and from pure socialism or humanitarianism on the  other.

I reject the doctrine of State sovereignty, which I held and  defended from 1828 to 1861, but still maintain that the  sovereignty of the American Republic vests in the States, though  in the States collectively, or united, not severally, and thus  escape alike consolidation and disintegration.  I find, with Mr.  Madison, our most philosophic statesman, the originality of the  American system in the division of powers between a General  government having sole charge of the foreign and general, and  particular or State governments having, within their respective  territories, sole charge of the particular relations and  interests of the American people; but I do not accept his  concession that this division is of conventional origin, and  maintain that it enters into the original Providential  constitution of the American state, as I have done in my Review  for October, 1863, and January and October, 1864. xii I maintain, after Mr.  Senator Sumner, one of the most  philosophic and accomplished living American statesmen, that  "State secession is State suicide," but modify the opinion I too  hastily expressed that the political death of a State dissolves  civil society within its territory and abrogates all rights held  under it, and accept the doctrine that the laws in force at the  time of secession remain in force till superseded or abrogated by  competent authority, and also that, till the State is revived and  restored as a State in the Union, the only authority, under the  American system, competent to supersede or abrogate them is the  United States, not Congress, far less the Executive.  The error  of the Government is not in recognizing the territorial laws as  surviving secession but in counting a State that has seceded as  still a State in the Union, with the right to be counted as one  of the United States in amending the Constitution.  Such State  goes out of the Union, but comes under it.

I have endeavored throughout to refer my particular political  views; to their general principles, and to show that the general  principles asserted have their origin and ground in the great,  universal, and unchanging principles of the universe itself.   Hence, I have labored to show the scientific relations of  political to theological principles, the xiii.                                          real principles of all  science, as of all reality.  An atheist, I have said, may be a  politician; but if there were no God, there could be no politics.   This may offend the sciolists of the age, but I must follow  science where it leads, and cannot be arrested by those who  mistake their darkness for light.

I write throughout as a Christian, because I am a Christian; as  a Catholic, because all Christian principles, nay, all real  principles are catholic, and there is nothing sectarian either  in nature or revelation.  I am a Catholic by God's grace and  great goodness, and must write as I am.  I could not write  otherwise if I would, and would not if I could.  I have not  obtruded my religion, and have referred to it only where my  argument demanded it; but I have had neither the weakness nor  the bad taste to seek to conceal or disguise it.  I could never  have written my book without the knowledge I have, as a Catholic,  of Catholic theology, and my acquaintance, slight as it is, with  the great fathers and doctors of the church, the great masters of  all that is solid or permanent in modern thought, either with  Catholics or non-Catholics.

Moreover, though I write for all Americans, without distinction  of sect or party, I have had more especially in view the people  of my own xiv           religious communion.  It is no discredit to a man in  the United States at the present day to be a firm, sincere, and  devout Catholic.  The old sectarian prejudice may remain with a  few, "whose eyes," as Emerson says, "are in their hind-head, not  in their fore-head;" but the American people are not at heart  sectarian, and the nothingarianism so prevalent among them only  marks their state of transition from sectarian opinions to  positive Catholic faith.  At any rate, it can no longer be  denied that Catholics are an integral, living, and growing  element in the American population, quite too numerous, too  wealthy, and too influential to be ignored.  They have played too  conspicuous a part in the late troubles of the country, and  poured out too freely and too much of their richest and noblest  blood in defence of the unity of the nation and the integrity of  its domain, for that.  Catholics henceforth must be treated as  standing, in all respects, on a footing of equality with any  other class of American citizens, and their views of political  science, or of any other science, be counted of equal importance,  and listened to with equal attention.

I have no fears that my book will be neglected because avowedly  by a Catholic author, and from a Catholic publishing house.  They xv who are not Catholics will read it, and it will enter into the  current of American literature, if it is one they must read in  order to be up with the living and growing thought of the age.   If it is not a book of that sort, it is not worth reading by any  one.

Furthermore, I am ambitious, even in my old age, and I wish to  exert an influence on the future of my country, for which I have  made, or, rather, my family have made, some sacrifices, and which  I tenderly love.  Now, I believe that he who can exert the most  influence on our Catholic population, especially in giving tone  and direction to our Catholic youth, will exert the most  influence in forming the character and shaping the future destiny  of the American Republic.  Ambition and patriotism alike, as well  as my own Catholic faith and sympathies, induce me to address  myself primarily to Catholics.  I quarrel with none of the sects;  I honor virtue wherever I see it, and accept truth wherever I  find it; but, in my belief, no sect is destined to a long life,  or a permanent possession.  I engage in no controversy with any  one not of my religion, for, if the positive, affirmative truth  is brought out and placed in a clear light before the public,  whatever is sectarian in any of the sects will disappear as the  morning mists before the rising sun.

xvi I expect the most intelligent and satisfactory appreciation of  my book from the thinking and educated classes among Catholics;  but I speak to my countrymen at large.  I could not personally  serve my country in the field: my habits as well as my  infirmities prevented, to say nothing of my age; but I have  endeavored in this humble work to add my contribution, small  though it may be, to political science, and to discharge, as far  as I am able, my debt of loyalty and patriotism.  I would the  book were more of a book, more worthy of my countrymen, and a  more weighty proof of the love I beat them, and with which I have  written it.  All I can say is, that it is an honest book, a  sincere book, and contains my best thoughts on the subjects  treated.  If well received, I shall be grateful; if neglected, I  shall endeavor to practise resignation, as I have so often done.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION


The ancients summed up the whole of human wisdom in the maxim,  Know Thyself, and certainly there is for an individual no more  important as there is no more difficult knowledge, than knowledge  of himself, whence he comes, whither he goes, what he is, what he  is for, what he can do, what he ought to do, and what are his  means of doing it.

Nations are only individuals on a larger scale.  They have a  life, an individuality, a reason, a conscience, and instincts of  their own, and have the same general laws of development and  growth, and, perhaps, of decay, as the individual man.  Equally  important, and no less difficult than for the individual, is it  for a nation to know itself, understand its own existence, its  own powers and faculties, rights and duties, constitution,  instincts, tendencies, and 2                            destiny.  A nation has a spiritual as  well as a material, a moral as well as a physical existence, and  is subjected to internal as well as external conditions of health  and virtue, greatness and grandeur, which it must in some measure  understand and observe, or become weak and infirm, stunted in its  growth, and end in premature decay and death.

Among nations, no one has more need of full knowledge of itself  than the United States, and no one has hitherto had less.  It has  hardly had a distinct consciousness of its own national existence,  and has lived the irreflective life of the child, with no severe  trial, till the recent rebellion, to throw it back on itself and  compel it to reflect on its own constitution, its own separate  existence, individuality, tendencies, and end.  The defection of  the slaveholding States, and the fearful struggle that has  followed for national unity and integrity, have brought it at  once to a distinct recognition of itself, and forced it to pass  from thoughtless, careless, heedless, reckless adolescence to  grave and reflecting manhood.  The nation has been suddenly  compelled to study itself, and henceforth must act from  reflection, understanding, science, statesmanship, not from  instinct, impulse, passion, or caprice, knowing well what 3                                                           it does,  and wherefore it does it.  The change which four years of civil  war have wrought in the nation is great, and is sure to give it  the seriousness, the gravity, the dignity, the manliness it has  heretofore lacked.

Though the nation has been brought to a consciousness of its own  existence, it has not, even yet, attained to a full and clear  understanding of its own national constitution.  Its vision is  still obscured by the floating mists of its earlier morning, and  its judgment rendered indistinct and indecisive by the wild  theories and fancies of its childhood.  The national mind has  been quickened, the national heart has been opened, the national  disposition prepared, but there remains the important work of  dissipating the mists that still linger, of brushing away these  wild theories and fancies, and of enabling it to form a clear  and intelligent judgment of itself, and a true and just  appreciation of its own constitution tendencies,--and destiny;  or, in other words, of enabling the nation to understand its own  idea, and the means of its actualization in space and time.

Every living nation has an idea given it by Providence to  realize, and whose realization is its special work, mission, or  destiny.  Every nation is, in some sense, a chosen people of 4                                                              God.   The Jews were the chosen people of God, through whom the  primitive traditions were to be preserved in their purity and  integrity, and the Messiah was to come.  The Greeks were the  chosen people of God, for the development and realization of the  beautiful or the divine splendor in art, and of the true in  science and philosophy; and the Romans, for the development of  the state, law, and jurisprudence.  The great despotic nations of  Asia were never properly nations; or if they were nations with a  mission, they proved false to it--, and count for nothing in the  progressive development of the human race.  History has not  recorded their mission, and as far as they are known they have  contributed only to the abnormal development or corruption of  religion and civilization.  Despotism is barbaric and abnormal.

The United States, or the American Republic, has a mission, and  is chosen of God for the realization of a great idea.  It has  been chosen not only to continue the work assigned to Greece and  Rome, but to accomplish a greater work than was assigned to  either.  In art, it will prove false to its mission if it do not  rival Greece; and in science and philosophy, if it do not surpass  it.  In the state, in law, in jurisprudence, it must continue and  surpass Rome.  Its idea 5                         is liberty, indeed, but liberty with law,  and law with liberty.  Yet its mission is not so much the  realization of liberty as the realization of the true idea of the  state, which secures at once the authority of the public and the  freedom of the individual--the sovereignty of the people without  social despotism, and individual freedom without anarchy.  In  other words, its mission is to bring out in its life the  dialectic union of authority and liberty, of the natural rights  of man and those of society.  The Greek and Roman republics  asserted the state to the detriment of individual freedom; modern  republics either do the same, or assert individual freedom to the  detriment of the state.  The American republic has been  instituted by Providence to realize the freedom of each with  advantage to the other.

The real mission of the United States is to introduce and  establish a political constitution, which, while it retains all  the advantages of the constitutions of states thus far known, is  unlike any of them, and secures advantages which none of them did  or could possess.  The American constitution has no prototype in  any prior constitution.  The American form of government can be  classed throughout with none of the forms of government described  by Aristotle, or 6                  even by later authorities.  Aristotle knew only  four forms of government: Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy, and  Mixed Governments.  The American form is none of these, nor any  combination of them.  It is original, a new contribution to  political science, and seeks to attain the end of all wise and  just government by means unknown or forbidden to the ancients,  and which have been but imperfectly comprehended even by American  political writers themselves.  The originality of the American  constitution has been overlooked by the great majority even of  our own statesmen, who seek to explain it by analogies borrowed  from the constitutions of other states rather than by a profound  study of its own principles.  They have taken too low a view of  it, and have rarely, if ever, appreciated its distinctive and  peculiar merits.

As the United States have vindicated their national unity and  integrity, and are preparing to take a new start in history,  nothing is more important than that they should take that new  start with a clear and definite view of their national  constitution, and with a distinct understanding of their  political mission in the future of the world.  The citizen who  can help his countrymen to do this will render them an im- 7                                                          portant  service and deserve well of his country, though he may have been  unable to serve in her armies and defend her on the battle-field.   The work now to be done by American statesmen is even more  difficult and more delicate than that which has been accomplished  by our brave armies.  As yet the people are hardly better  prepared for the political work to be done than they were at the  outbreak of the civil war for the military work they have so  nobly achieved.  But, with time, patience, and good-will, the  difficulties may be overcome, the errors of the past corrected,  and the Government placed on the right track for the future.

It will hardly be questioned that either the constitution of the  United States is very defective or it has been very grossly  misinterpreted by all parties.  If the slave States had not held  that the States are severally sovereign, and the Constitution of  the United States a simple agreement or compact, they would never  have seceded; and if the Free States had not confounded the Union  with the General government, and shown a tendency to make it the  entire national government, no occasion or pretext for secession  would have been given.  The great problem of our statesmen has  been from the first, How to assert union without 8                                                  consolidation,  and State rights without disintegration?  Have they, as yet,  solved that problem?  The war has silenced the State sovereignty  doctrine, indeed, but has it done so without lesion to State  rights?  Has it done it without asserting the General government  as the supreme, central, or national government?  Has it done it  without striking a dangerous blow at the federal element of the  constitution?  In suppressing by armed force the doctrine that  the States are severally sovereign, what barrier is left against  consolidation?  Has not one danger been removed only to give  place to another?

But perhaps the constitution itself, if rightly understood,  solves the problem; and perhaps the problem itself is raised  precisely through misunderstanding of the constitution.  Our  statesmen have recognized no constitution of the American people  themselves; they have confined their views to the written  constitution, as if that constituted the American people a state  or nation, instead of being, as it is, only a law ordained by the  nation already existing and constituted.  Perhaps, if they had  recognized and studied the constitution which preceded that drawn  up by the Convention of 1787, and which is intrinsic, inherent in  the 9     republic itself, they would have seen that it solves the  problem, and asserts national unity without consolidation, and  the rights of the several States without danger of disintegration.   The whole controversy, possibly, has originated in a  misunderstanding of the real constitution of the United States,  and that misunderstanding itself in the misunderstanding of the  origin and constitution of government in general.  The  constitution, as will appear in the course of this essay is not  defective; and all that is necessary to guard against either  danger is to discard all our theories of the constitution, and  return and adhere to the constitution itself, as it really is and  always has been.

There is no doubt that the question of Slavery had much to do  with the rebellion, but it was not its sole cause.  The real  cause must be sought in the program that had been made,  especially in the States themselves, in forming and administering  their respective governments, as well as the General government,  in accordance with political theories borrowed from European  speculators on government, the socalled Liberals and  Revolutionists, which have and can have no legitimate application  in the United States.  The tendency of American politics, for the  last thirty or forty years, has 10                                 been, within the several States  themselves, in the direction of centralized democracy, as if the  American people had for their mission only the reproduction of  ancient Athens.  The American system is not that of any of the  simple forms of government, nor any combination of them.  The  attempt to bring it under any of the simple or mixed forms of  government recognized by political writers, is an attempt to  clothe the future in the cast-off garments of the past.  The  American system, wherever practicable, is better than monarchy,  better than aristocracy, better than simple democracy, better  than any possible combination of these several forms, because it  accords more nearly with the principles of things, the real order  of the universe.

But American statesmen have studied the constitutions of other  states more than that of their own, and have succeeded in  obscuring the American system in the minds of the people, and  giving them in its place pure and simple democracy, which is its  false development or corruption.  Under the influence of this  false development, the people were fast losing sight of the  political truth that, though the people are sovereign, it is the  organic, not the inorganic people, the territorial people, not  the people as 11               simple population, and were beginning to assert the  absolute God-given right of the majority to govern.  All the  changes made in the bosom of the States themselves have consisted  in removing all obstacles to the irresponsible will of the  majority, leaving minorities and individuals at their mercy.   This tendency to a centralized democracy had more to do with  provoking secession and rebellion than the anti-slavery  sentiments of the Northern, Central, and Western States.

The failure of secession and the triumph of the National cause,  in spite of the short-sightedness and blundering of the  Administration, have proved the vitality and strength of the  national constitution, and the greatness of the American people.   They say nothing for or against the democratic theory of our  demagogues, but every thing in favor of the American system or  constitution of government, which has found a firmer support in  American instincts than in American statesmanship.  In spite of  all that had been done by theorists, radicals, and revolutionists,  no-government men, non-resistants, humanitarians, and sickly  sentimentalists to corrupt the American people in mind, heart,  and body, the native vigor of their national constitution has  enabled them to come forth  12                            triumphant from the trial.  Every  American patriot has reason to be proud of his country-men, and  every American lover of freedom to be satisfied with the  institutions of his country.  But there is danger that the  politicians and demagogues will ascribe the merit, not to the  real and living national constitution, but to their miserable  theories of that constitution, and labor to aggravate the several  evils and corrupt tendencies which caused the rebellion it has  cost so much to suppress.  What is now wanted is, that the people,  whose instincts are right, should understand the American  constitution as it is, and so understand it as to render it  impossible for political theorists, no matter of what school or  party, to deceive them again as to its real import, or induce  them to depart from it in their political action.

A work written with temper, without passion or sectional  prejudice, in a philosophical spirit, explaining to the American  people their own national constitution, and the mutual relations  of the General government and the State governments, cannot, at  this important crisis in our affairs, be inopportune, and, if  properly executed, can hardly fail to be of real service.  Such a  work is now attempted--would it were by another and abler hand-- 13 which, imperfect as it is, may at least offer some useful  suggestions, give a right direction to political thought,  although it should fail to satisfy the mind of the reader.

This much the author may say, in favor of his own work, that it  sets forth no theory of government in general, or of the United  States in particular.  The author is not a monarchist, an  aristocrat, a democrat, a feudalist, nor an advocate of what are  called mixed governments like the English, at least for his own  country; but is simply an American, devoted to the real, living,  and energizing constitution of the American republic as it is,  not as some may fancy it might be, or are striving to make it.   It is, in his judgment, what it ought to be, and he has no other  ambition than to present it as it is to the understanding and  love of his countrymen.

Perhaps simple artistic unity and propriety would require the  author to commence his essay directly with the United States; but  while the constitution of the United States is original and  peculiar, the government of the United States has necessarily  something in common with all legitimate governments, and he has  thought it best to precede his discussion of the American  republic, its constitution, tenden- 14                                   cies, and destiny, by some  considerations on government in general.  He does this because he  believes, whether rightly or not, that while the American people  have received from Providence a most truly profound and admirable  system of government, they are more or less infected with the  false theories of government which have been broached during the  last two centuries.  In attempting to realize these theories,  they have already provoked or rendered practicable a rebellion  which has seriously threatened the national existence, and come  very near putting an end to the American order of civilization  itself.  These theories have received already a shock in the  minds of all serious and thinking men; but the men who think are  in every nation a small minority, and it is necessary to give  these theories a public refutation, and bring back those who do  not think, as well as those who do, from the world of dreams to  the world of reality.  It is hoped, therefore, that any apparent  want of artistic unity or symmetry in the essay will be pardoned  for the sake of the end the author has had in view.






CHAPTER II.

GOVERNMENT.


Man is a dependent being, and neither does nor can suffice for  himself.  He lives not in himself, but lives and moves and has  his being in God.  He exists, develops, and fulfils his existence  only by communion with God, through which he participates of the  divine being and life.  He communes with God through the divine  creative act and the Incarnation of the Word, through his kind,  and through the material world.  Communion with God through  Creation and Incarnation is religion, distinctively taken, which  binds man to God as his first cause, and carries him onward to  God as his final cause; communion through the material world is  expressed by the word property; and communion with God through  humanity is society.  Religion, society, property, are the three  terms that embrace the whole of man's life, and express the  essential means and conditions of his existence, his development,  and his perfec- 16                tion, or the fulfilment of his existence, the  attainment of the end for which he is created.

Though society, or the communion of man with his Maker through  his kind, is not all that man needs in order to live, to grow,  to actualize the possibilities of his nature, and to attain to  his beatitude, since humanity is neither God nor the material  universe, it is yet a necessary and essential condition of his  life, his progress, and the completion of his existence.  He is  born and lives in society, and can be born and live nowhere else.   It is one of the necessities of his nature.  "God saw that it was  not good for man to be alone."  Hence, wherever man is found he  is found in society, living in more or less strict intercourse  with his kind.

But society never does and never can exist without government of  some sort.  As society is a necessity of man's nature, so is  government a necessity of society.  The simplest form of society  is the family--Adam and Eve.  But though Adam and Eve are in many  respects equal, and have equally important though different parts  assigned them, one or the other must be head and governor, or  they cannot form the society called family.  They would be simply  two individuals of different sexes, and the family would fail for  the want of unity.

17 Children cannot be reared, trained, or educated without some  degree of family government, of some authority to direct,  control, restrain, or prescribe.  Hence the authority of the  husband and father is recognized by the common consent of  mankind.  Still more apparent is the necessity of government the  moment the family develops and grows into the tribe, and the  tribe into the nation.  Hence no nation exists without  government; and we never find a savage tribe, however low or  degraded, that does not assert somewhere in the father, in the  elders, or in the tribe itself, the rude outlines or the faint  reminiscences of some sort of government, with authority to  demand obedience and to punish the refractory.  Hence, as man is  nowhere found out of society, so nowhere is society found without  government.

Government is necessary: but let it be remarked by the way, that  its necessity does not grow exclusively or chiefly out of the  fact that the human race by sin has fallen from its primitive  integrity, or original righteousness.  The fall asserted by  Christian theology, though often misinterpreted, and its effects  underrated or exaggerated, is a fact too sadly confirmed by  individual experience and universal history; but it is not the  cause why government is neces- 18                              sary, though it may be an additional  reason for demanding it.  Government would have been necessary if  man had not sinned, and it is needed for the good as well as for  the bad.  The law was promulgated in the Garden, while man  retained his innocence and remained in the integrity of his  nature.  It exists in heaven as well as on earth, and in heaven  in its perfection.  Its office is not purely repressive, to  restrain violence, to redress wrongs, and to punish the  transgressor.  It has something more to do than to restrict our  natural liberty, curb our passions, and maintain justice between  man and man.  Its office is positive as well as negative.  It is  needed to render effective the solidarity of the individuals of a  nation, and to render the nation an organism, not a mere  organization--to combine men in one living body, and to  strengthen all with the strength of each, and each with the  strength of all--to develop, strengthen, and sustain individual  liberty, and to utilize and direct it to the promotion of the  common weal--to be a social providence, imitating in its order  and degree the action of the divine providence itself, and, while  it provides for the common good of all, to protect each, the  lowest and meanest, with the whole force and majesty of society.   It is the minister of wrath to wrong- 19                                     doers, indeed, but its nature  is beneficent, and its action defines and protects the right of  property, creates and maintains a medium in which religion can  exert her supernatural energy, promotes learning, fosters science  and art, advances civilization, and contributes as a powerful  means to the fulfilment by man of the Divine purpose in his  existence.  Next after religion, it is man's greatest good; and  even religion without it can do only a small portion of her work.   They wrong it who call it a necessary evil; it is a great good,  and, instead of being distrusted, hated, or resisted, except in  its abuses, it should be loved, respected, obeyed, and if need  be, defended at the cost of all earthly goods, and even of life  itself.

The nature or essence of government is to govern.  A government  that does not govern, is simply no government at all.  If it has  not the ability to govern and governs not, it may be an agency,  an instrument in the bands of individuals for advancing their  private interests, but it is not government.  To be government it  must govern both individuals and the community.  If it is a mere  machine for making prevail the will of one man, of a certain  number of men, or even of the community, it may be very effective  sometimes for good, sometimes 20                               for evil, oftenest for evil, but  government in the proper sense of the word it is not.  To govern  is to direct, control, restrain, as the pilot controls and  directs his ship.  It necessarily implies two terms, governor and  governed, and a real distinction between them.  The denial of all  real distinction between governor and governed is an error in  politics analogous to that in philosophy or theology of denying  all real distinction between creator and creature, God and the  universe, which all the world knows is either pantheism or pure  atheism--the supreme sophism.  If we make governor and governed  one and the same, we efface both terms; for there is no governor  nor governed, if the will that governs is identically the will  that is governed.  To make the controller and the controlled the  same is precisely to deny all control.  There must, then, if  there is government at all, be a power, force, or will that  governs, distinct from that which is governed.  In those  governments in which it is held that the people govern, the  people governing do and must act in a diverse relation from the  people governed, or there is no real government.

Government is not only that which governs, but that which has the  right or authority to govern.  Power without right is not  govern- 21       ment.  Governments have the right to use force at need, but  might does not make right, and not every power wielding the  physical force of a nation is to be regarded as its rightful  government.  Whatever resort to physical force it may be obliged  to make, either in defence of its authority or of the rights of  the nation, the government itself lies in the moral order, and  politics is simply a branch of ethics--that branch which treats  of the rights and duties of men in their public relations, as  distinguished from their rights and duties in their private  relations.

Government being not only that which governs, but that which has  the right to govern, obedience to it becomes a moral duty, not a  mere physical necessity.  The right to govern and the duty to  obey are correlatives, and the one cannot exist or be conceived  without the other.  Hence loyalty is not simply an amiable  sentiment but a duty, a moral virtue.  Treason is not merely a  difference in political opinion with the governing authority, but  a crime against the sovereign, and a moral wrong, therefore a sin  against God, the Founder of the moral Law.  Treason, if committed  in other Countries, unhappily, has been more frequently termed by  our countrymen Patriotism and loaded with honor than branded as a  crime, the 22            greatest of crimes, as it is, that human governments  have authority to punish.  The American people have been chary of  the word loyalty, perhaps because they regard it as the  correlative of royalty; but loyalty is rather the correlative of  law, and is, in its essence, love and devotion to the sovereign  authority, however constituted or wherever lodged.  It is as  necessary, as much a duty, as much a virtue in republics as in  monarchies; and nobler examples of the most devoted loyalty are  not found in the world's history than were exhibited in the  ancient Greek and Roman republics, or than have been exhibited by  both men and women in the young republic of the United States.   Loyalty is the highest, noblest, and most generous of human  virtues, and is the human element of that sublime love or charity  which the inspired Apostle tells us is the fulfilment of the law.   It has in it the principle of devotion, of self-sacrifice, and  is, of all human virtues, that which renders man the most  Godlike.  There is nothing great, generous, good, or heroic of  which a truly loyal people are not capable, and nothing mean,  base, cruel, brutal, criminal, detestable, not to be expected of  a really disloyal people.  Such a people no generous sentiment  can move, no love can bind.  It mocks at duty, scorns vir- 23                                                          tue,  tramples on all rights, and holds no person, no thing, human or  divine, sacred or inviolable.  The assertion of government as  lying in the moral order, defines civil liberty, and reconciles  it with authority.  Civil liberty is freedom to do whatever one  pleases that authority permits or does not forbid.  Freedom to  follow in all things one's own will or inclination, without any  civil restraint, is license, not liberty.  There is no lesion to  liberty in repressing license, nor in requiring obedience to the  commands of the authority that has the right to command.  Tyranny  or oppression is not in being subjected to authority, but in  being subjected to usurped authority--to a power that has no  right to command, or that commands what exceeds its right or its  authority.  To say that it is contrary to liberty to be forced to  forego our own will or inclination in any case whatever, is  simply denying the right of all government, and falling into  no-governmentism.  Liberty is violated only when we are required  to forego our own will or inclination by a power that has no  right to make the requisition; for we are bound to obedience as  far as authority has right to govern, and we can never have the  right to disobey a rightful command.  The requisition, if made by  right- 24      ful authority, then, violates no right that we have or can  have, and where there is no violation of our rights there is no  violation of our liberty.  The moral right of authority, which  involves the moral duty of obedience, presents, then, the ground  on which liberty and authority may meet in peace and operate to  the same end.

This has no resemblance to the slavish doctrine of passive  obedience, and that the resistance to power can never be lawful.   The tyrant may be lawfully resisted, for the tyrant, by force of  the word itself, is a usurper, and without authority.  Abuses of  power may be resisted even by force when they become too great to  be endured, when there is no legal or regular way of redressing  them, and when there is a reasonable prospect that resistance  will prove effectual and substitute something better in their  place.  But it is never lawful to resist the rightful sovereign,  for it can never be right to resist right, and the rightful  sovereign in the constitutional exercise of his power can never  be said to abuse it.  Abuse is the unconstitutional or wrongful  exercise of a power rightfully held, and when it is not so  exercised there is no abuse or abuses to redress.  All turns,  then, on the right of power, or its legitimacy.  Whence does  government de- 25              rive its right to govern?  What is the origin and  ground of sovereignty?  This question is fundamental and without  a true answer to it politics cannot be a science, and there can  be no scientific statesmanship.  Whence, then, comes the  sovereign right to govern?





26 CHAPTER III.

ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT


Government is both a fact and a right.  Its origin as a fact, is  simply a question of history; its origin as a right or authority  to govern, is a question of ethics.  Whether a certain territory  and its population are a sovereign state or nation, or  not--whether the actual ruler of a country is its rightful ruler,  or not--is to be determined by the historical facts in the case;  but whence the government derives its right to govern, is a  question that can be solved only by philosophy, or, philosophy  failing, only by revelation.

Political writers, not carefully distinguishing between the fact  and the right, have invented various theories as to the origin of  government, among which may be named-- I. Government originates in the right of the father to govern his  child. II. It originates in convention, and is a social compact. 27 III. It originates in the people, who, collectively taken, are  sovereign. IV. Government springs from the spontaneous development of nature. V. It derives its right from the immediate and express  appointment of God;-- VI. From God through the Pope, or visible head of the spiritual  society;-- VII. From God through the people;-- VIII. From God through the natural law.

I. The first theory is sound, if the question is confined to the  origin of government as a fact.  The patriarchal system is the  earliest known system of government, and unmistakable traces of  it are found in nearly all known governments--in the tribes of  Arabia and Northern Africa, the Irish septs and the Scottish  clans, the Tartar hordes, the Roman qentes, and the Russian and  Hindoo villages.  The right of the father was held to be his  right to govern his family or household, which, with his children,  included his wife and servants.  From the family to the tribe the  transition is natural and easy, as also from the tribe to the  nation.  The father is chief of the family; the chief of the  eldest family is chief of the tribe; the chief of the eldest  tribe becomes chief of the nation, 28                                    and, as such, king or monarch.   The heads of families collected in a senate form an aristocracy,  and the families themselves, represented by their delegates, or  publicly assembling for public affairs, constitute a democracy.   These three forms, with their several combinations, to wit,  monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, and mixed governments, are all  the forms known to Aristotle, and have generally been held to be  all that are possible.

Historically, all governments have, in some sense, been developed  from the patriarchal, as all society has been developed from the  family.  Even those governments, like the ancient Roman and the  modern feudal, which seem to be founded on landed property, may  be traced back to a patriarchal origin.  The patriarch is sole  proprietor, and the possessions of the family are vested in him,  and he governs as proprietor as well as father.  In the tribe,  the chief is the proprietor, and in the nation, the king is the  landlord, and holds the domain.  Hence, the feudal baron is  invested with his fief by the suzerain, holds it from him, and to  him it escheats when forfeited or vacant.  All the great Asiatic  kings of ancient or modern times hold the domain and govern as  proprietors; they have the authority of the father and 29                                                        the owner;  and their subjects, though theoretically their children, are  really their slaves.

In Rome, however, the proprietary right undergoes an important  transformation.  The father retains all the power of the  patriarch within his family, the patrician in his gens or house,  but, outside of it, is met and controlled by the city or state.   The heads of houses are united in the senate, and collectively  constitute and govern the state.  Yet, not all the heads of  houses have seats in the senate, but only the tenants of the  sacred territory of the city, which has been surveyed and marked  by the god Terminus.  Hence the great plebeian houses, often  richer and nobler than the patrician, were excluded from all  share in the government and the honors of the state, because they  were not tenants of any portion of the sacred territory.  There  is here the introduction of an element which is not patriarchal,  and which transforms the patriarch or chief of a tribe into the  city or state, and founds the civil order, or what is now called  civilization.  The city or state takes the place of the private  proprietor, and territorial rights take the place of purely  personal rights.

In the theory of the Roman law, the land owns the man, not the  man the land.  When land was transferred to a new tenant, the  prac- 30     tice in early times was to bury him in it, in order to  indicate that it took possession of him, received, accepted, or  adopted him; and it was only such persons as were taken  possession of, accepted or adopted by the sacred territory or  domain that, though denizens of Rome, were citizens with full  political rights.  This, in modern language, means that the state  is territorial, not personal, and that the citizen appertains to  the state, not the state to the citizen.  Under the patriarchal,  the tribal, and the Asiatic monarchical systems, there is,  properly speaking, no state, no citizens, and the organization is  economical rather than political.  Authority--even the nation  itself--is personal, not territorial.  The patriarch, the chief  of the tribe, or the king, is the only proprietor.  Under the  Graeco-Roman system all this is transformed.  The nation is  territorial as well as personal, and the real proprietor is the  city or state.  Under the Empire, no doubt, what lawyers call the  eminent domain was vested in the emperor, but only as the  representative and trustee of the city or state.

When or by what combination of events this transformation was  effected, history does not inform us.  The first-born of Adam, we  are told, built a city, and called it after his son 31                                                     Enoch; but  there is no evidence that it was constituted a municipality.  The  earliest traces of the civil order proper are found in the Greek  and Italian republics, and its fullest and grandest developments  are found in Rome, imperial as well as republican.  It was no  doubt preceded by the patriarchal system, and was historically  developed from it, but by way of accretion rather than by simple  explication.  It has in it an element that, if it exists in the  patriarchal constitution, exists there only in a different form,  and the transformation marks the passage from the economical  order to the political, from the barbaric to the civil  constitution of society, or from barbarism to civilization.

The word civilization stands opposed to barbarism, and is derived  from civitas--city or state.  The Greeks and Romans call all  tribes and nations in which authority is vested in the chief, as  distinguished from the state, barbarians.  The origin of the word  barbarian, barbarus, or ........, is unknown, and its primary  sense can be only conjectured.  Webster regards its primary sense  as foreign, wild, fierce; but this could not have been its  original sense; for the Greeks and Romans never termed all  foreigners barbarians, and they applied the 32                                             term to nations that  had no inconsiderable culture and refinement of manners, and that  had made respectable progress in art and sciences--the Indians,  Persians, Medians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians.  They applied the  term evidently in a political, not an ethical or an aesthetical  sense, and as it would seem to designate a social order in which  the state was not developed, and in which the nation was personal,  not territorial, and authority was held as a private right, not  as a public trust, or in which the domain vests in the chief or  tribe, and not in the state; for they never term any others  barbarians.

Republic is opposed not to monarchy, in the modern European  sense, but to monarchy in the ancient or absolute sense.   Lacedaemon had kings; yet it was no less republican than Athens;  and Rome was called and was a republic under the emperors no less  than under the consuls.  Republic, respublica, by the very force  of the term, means the public wealth, or, in good English, the  commonwealth; that is, government founded not on personal or  private wealth, but on the public wealth, public territory, or  domain, or a Government that vests authority in the nation, and  attaches the nation to a certain definite territory.  France,  Spain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, even Great 33                                                     Britain in  substance though not in form, are all, in the strictest sense of  the word, republican states; for the king or emperor does not  govern in his own private right, but solely as representative of  the power and majesty of the state.  The distinctive mark of  republicanism is the substitution of the state for the personal  chief, and public authority for personal or private right.   Republicanism is really civilization as opposed to barbarism, and  all civility, in the old Sense of the word, or Civilian in  Italian, is republican, and is applied in modern tiles to  breeding or refinement of manners, simply because these are  characteristics of a republican, or polished [from ....., city]  people.  Every people that has a real civil order, or a fully  developed state or polity, is a republican people; and hence the  church and her great doctors when they speak of the state as  distinguished from the church, call it the republic, as may be  seen by consulting even a late Encyclical of Pius IX., which some  have interpreted wrongly in an anti-republican sense.

All tribes and nations in which the patriarchal system remains,  or is developed without transformation, are barbaric, and really  so regarded by all Christendom.  In civilized nations the  patriarchal authority is transformed into 34                                           that of the city or  state, that is, of the republic; but in all barbarous nations it  retains its Private and personal character.  The nation is only  the family or tribe, and is called by the name of its ancestor,  founder, or chief, not by a geographical denomination.  Race has  not been supplanted by country; they are a people, not a state.   They are not fixed to the soil, and though we may find in them  ardent love of family, the tribe, or the chief, we never find  among them that pure love of country or patriotism which so  distinguished the Greeks and Romans, and is no less marked among  modern Christian nations.  They have a family, a race, a chief or  king, but no patria, or country.  The barbarians who overthrew  the Roman Empire, whether of the West or the East, were nations,  or confederacies of nations, but not states.  The nation with  them was personal, not territorial.  Their country was wherever  they fed their flocks and herds, pitched their tents, and  encamped for the night.  There were Germans, but no German state,  and even to-day the German finds his "father-land" wherever the  German speech is spoken.  The Polish, Sclavonian, Hungarian,  Illyrian, Italian, and other provinces held by German states, in  which the German language is not the mother-tongue, are excluded  from 35      the Germanic Confederation.  The Turks, or Osmanlis, are a  race, not a state, and are encamped, not settled, on the site of  the Eastern Roman or Greek Empire.

Even when the barbaric nations have ceased to be nomadic,  pastoral, or predatory nations, as the ancient Assyrians and  Persians or modern Chinese, and have their geographical  boundaries, they have still no state, no country.  The nation  defines the boundaries, not the boundaries the nation.  The  nation does not belong to the territory, but the territory to the  nation or its chief.  The Irish and Anglo-Saxons, in former  times, held the land in gavelkind, and the territory belonged to  the tribe or sept; but if the tribe held it as indivisible, they  still held it as private property.  The shah of Persia holds the  whole Persian territory as private property, and the landholders  among his subjects are held to be his tenants.  They hold it from  him, not from the Persian state.

The public domain of the Greek empire is in theory the private  domain of the Ottoman emperor or Turkish sultan.  There is in  barbaric states no republic, no commonwealth; authority is  parental, without being tempered by parental affection.  The  chief is a despot, and rules with the united authority of the 36 father and the harshness of the proprietor.  He owns the land and  his subjects.

Feudalism, established in Western Europe after the downfall of  the Roman Empire, however modified by the Church and by  reminiscences of Graeco-Roman civilization retained by the  conquered, was a barbaric constitution.  The feudal monarch, as  far as he governed at all, governed as proprietor or landholder,  not as the representative of the commonwealth.  Under feudalism  there are estates, but no state.  The king governs as an estate,  the nobles hold their power as an estate, and the commons are  represented as an estate.  The whole theory of power is, that it  is an estate; a private right, not a public trust.  It is not  without reason, then that the common sense of civilized nations  terms the ages when it prevailed in Western Europe barbarous ages.

It may seem a paradox to class democracy with the barbaric  constitutions, and yet as it is defended by many stanch  democrats, especially European democrats and revolutionists, and  by French and Germans settled in our own country, it is  essentially barbaric and anti-republican.  The characteristic  principle of barbarism is, that power is a private or personal  right, and when democrats assert that the elective fran- 37                                                        chise is a  natural right of man, or that it is held by virtue of the fact  that the elector is a man, they assert the fundamental principle  of barbarism and despotism.  This says nothing in favor of  restricted suffrage, or against what is called universal suffrage.   To restrict suffrage to property-holders helps nothing,  theoretically or practically.  Property has of itself advantages  enough, without clothing its holders with exclusive political  rights and privileges, and the laboring classes any day are as  trustworthy as the business classes.  The wise statesman will  never restrict suffrage, or exclude the poorer and more numerous  classes from all voice in the government of their country.   General suffrage is wise, and if Louis Philippe had had the sense  to adopt it, and thus rally the whole nation to the support of  his government, he would never have had to encounter the  revolution of 1848.  The barbarism, the despotism, is not in  universal suffrage, but in defending the elective franchise as a  private or personal right.  It is not a private, but a political  right, and, like all political rights, a public trust.  Extremes  meet, and thus it is that men who imagine that they march at the  head of the human race and lead the civilization of the age, are  really in principle retrograding to the 38                                         barbarism of the past, or  taking their place with nations on whom the light of civilization  has never yet dawned.  All is not gold that glisters.

The characteristic of barbarism is, that it makes all authority a  private or personal right; and the characteristic of civilization  is, that it makes it a public trust.  Barbarism knows only  persons; civilization asserts and maintains the state.  With  barbarians the authority of the patriarch is developed simply by  way of explication; in civilized states it is developed by way of  transformation.  Keeping in mind this distinction, it may be  maintained that all systems of government, as a simple historical  fact, have been developed from the patriarchal.  The patriarchal  has preceded them all, and it is with the patriarchal that the  human race has begun its career.  The family or household is not  a state, a civil polity, but it is a government, and,  historically considered, is the initial or inchoate state as well  as the initial or inchoate nation.  But its simple direct  development gives us barbarism, or what is called Oriental  despotism, and which nowhere exists, or can exist, in Christendom.   It is found only in pagan and Mohammedan nations; Christianity in  the secular order is republican, and continues 39                                                and completes the  work of Greece and Rome.  It meets with little permanent success  in any patriarchal or despotic nation, and must either find or  create civilization, which has been developed from the patriarchal  system by way of transformation.

But, though the patriarchal system is the earliest form of  government, and all governments have been developed or modified  from it, the right of government to govern cannot be deduced from  the right of the father to govern his children, for the parental  right itself is not ultimate or complete.  All governments that  assume it to be so, and rest on it as the foundation of their  authority, are barbaric or despotic, and, therefore , without any  legitimate authority.  The right to govern rests on ownership or  dominion.  Where there is no proprietorship, there is no dominion;  and where there is no dominion, there is no right to govern.   Only he who is sovereign proprietor is sovereign lord.

Property, ownership, dominion rests on creation.  The maker has  the right to the thing made.  He, so far as he is sole creator,  is sole proprietor, and may do what he will with it.  God is  sovereign lord and proprietor of the universe because He is its  sole creator.  He 40                   hath the absolute dominion, because He is  absolute maker.  He has made it, He owns it; and one may do what  he will with his own.  His dominion is absolute, because He is  absolute creator, and He rightly governs as absolute and  universal lord; yet is He no despot, because He exercises only  His sovereign right, and His own essential wisdom, goodness,  justness, rectitude, and immutability, are the highest of all  conceivable guaranties that His exercise of His power will always  be right, wise, just, and good.  The despot is a man attempting  to be God upon earth, and to exercise a usurped power.  Despotism  is based on, the parental right, and the parental right is  assumed to be absolute.  Hence, your despotic rulers claim to  reign, and to be loved and worshipped as gods.  Even the Roman  emperors, in the fourth and fifth centuries, were addressed as  divinities; and Theodosius the Great, a Christian , was addressed  as "Your Eternity," Eternitas vestras--so far did barbarism  encroach on civilization, even under Christian emperors.

The right of the father over his child is an imperfect right, for  he is the generator, not the creator of his child.  Generation is  in the order of second causes, and is simply the development or  explication of the race.  The 41                               early Roman law, founded on the  confusion of generation with creation, gave the father absolute  authority over the child--the right of life and death, as over  his servants or slaves; but this was restricted under the Empire,  and in all Christian nations the authority of the father is  treated, like all power, as a trust.  The child, like the father  himself, belongs to the state, and to the state the father is  answerable for the use he makes of his authority.  The law fixes  the age of majority, when the child is completely emancipated;  and even during his nonage, takes him from the father and places  him under guardians, in case the father is incompetent to fulfil  or grossly abuses his trust.  This is proper, because society  contributes to the life of the child, and has a right as well as  an interest in him.  Society, again, must suffer if the child is  allowed to grow up a worthless vagabond or a criminal; and has a  right to intervene, both in behalf of itself and of the child, in  case his parents neglect to train him up in the nurture and  admonition of the Lord, or are training him up to be a liar, a  thief, a drunkard, a murderer, a pest to the community.  How,  then, base the right of society on the right of the father,  since, in point of fact, the 42                              right of society is paramount to the  right of the parent?

But even waiving this, and granting what is not the fact that the  authority of the father is absolute, unlimited, it cannot be the  ground of the right of society to govern.  Assume the parental  right to be perfect and inseparable from the parental relation,  it is no right to govern where no such relation exists.  Nothing  true, real, solid in government can be founded on what Carlyle  calls a "sham."  The statesman, if worthy of the name, ascertains  and conforms to the realities, the verities of things; and all  jurisprudence that accepts legal fictions is imperfect, and even  censurable.  The presumptions or assumptions of law or politics  must have a real and solid basis, or they are inadmissible.  How,  from the right of the father to govern his own child, born from  his loins, conclude his right to govern one not his child?  Or  how, from my right to govern my child, conclude the right of  society to found the state, institute government, and exercise  political authority over its members?





CHAPTER IV.

ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT--CONTINUED.


II. Rejecting the patriarchal theory as untenable, and shrinking  from asserting the divine origin of government, lest they should  favor theocracy, and place secular society under the control of  the clergy, and thus disfranchise the laity, modern political  writers have sought to render government purely human, and  maintain that its origin is conventional, and that it is founded  in compact or agreement.  Their theory originated in the  seventeenth century, and was predominant in the last century and  the first third of the present.  It has been, and perhaps is yet,  generally accepted by American politicians and statesmen, at  least so far as they ever trouble their heads with the question  at all, which it must be confessed is not far.

The moral theologians of the Church have generally spoken of  government as a social pact or compact, and explained the  reciprocal rights and obligations of subjects and rulers by the  44 general law of contracts; but they have never held that  government originates in a voluntary agreement between the people  and their rulers, or between the several individuals composing  the community.  They have never held that government has only a  conventional origin or authority.  They have simply meant, by the  social compact, the mutual relations and reciprocal rights and  duties of princes and their subjects, as implied in the very  existence and nature of civil society.  Where there are rights  and duties on each side, they treat the fact, not as an agreement  voluntarily entered into, and which creates them, but as a  compact which binds alike sovereign and subject; and in  determining whether either side has sinned or not, they inquire  whether either has broken the terms of the social compact.  They  were engaged, not with the question whence does government derive  its authority, but with its nature, and the reciprocal rights and  duties of governors and the governed.  The compact itself they  held was not voluntarily formed by the people themselves, either  individually or collectively, but was imposed by God, either  immediately, or mediately, through the law of nature.  "Every  man," says Cicero, "is born in society, and remains there."  They  held the 45          same, and maintained that every one born into society  contracts by that fact certain obligations to society, and  society certain obligations to him; for under the natural law,  every one has certain rights, as life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, and owes certain duties to society for the  protection and assistance it affords him.

But modern political theorists have abused the phrase borrowed  from the theologians, and made it cover a political doctrine  which they would have been the last to accept.  These theorists  or political speculators have imagined a state of nature  antecedently to civil society, in which men lived without  government, law, or manners, out of which they finally came by  entering into a voluntary agreement with some one of their number  to be king and to govern them, or with one another to submit to  the rule of the majority.  Hobbes, the English materialist, is  among the earliest and most distinguished of the advocates of  this theory.  He held that men lived, prior to the creation of  civil society, in a state of nature, in which all were equal, and  every one had an equal right to every thing, and to take any  thing on which he could lay his hands and was strong enough to  hold.  There was no law but the will of the strongest.  Hence,  the state of nature was a state of con- 46                                       tinual war.  At length,  wearied and disgusted, men sighed for peace, and, with one  accord, said to the tallest, bravest, or ablest among them: Come,  be our king, our master, our sovereign lord, and govern us; we  surrender our natural rights and our natural independence to you,  with no other reserve or condition than that you maintain peace  among us, keep us from robbing and plundering one another or  cutting each other's throats.

Locke followed Hobbes, and asserted virtually the same theory,  but asserted it in the interests of liberty, as Hobbes had  asserted it in the interests of power.  Rousseau, a citizen of  Geneva, followed in the next century with his Contrat Social, the  text-book of the French revolutionists--almost their Bible--and  put the finishing stroke to the theory.  Hitherto the compact or  agreement had been assumed to be between the governor and the  governed; Rousseau supposes it to be between the people  themselves, or a compact to which the people are the only parties.   He adopts the theory of a state of nature in which men lived,  antecedently to their forming themselves into civil society,  without government or law.  All men in that state were equal, and  each was independent and sovereign proprietor of himself.  These  equal, independent, sovereign 47                               individuals met, or are held to  have met, in convention, and entered into a compact with  themselves, each with all, and all with each, that they would  constitute government, and would each submit to the determination  and authority of the whole, practically of the fluctuating and  irresponsible majority.  Civil society, the state, the  government, originates in this compact, and the government, as  Mr. Jefferson asserts in the Declaration of American  Independence, "derives its just powers from the consent of the  governed."

This theory, as so set forth, or as modified by asserting that  the individual delegates instead of surrendering his rights to  civil society, was generally adopted by the American people in  the last century, and is still the more prevalent theory with  those among them who happen to have any theory or opinion on the  subject.  It is the political tradition of the country.  The  state, as defined by the elder Adams, is held to be a voluntary  association of individuals.  Individuals create civil society,  and may uncreate it whenever they judge it advisable.  Prior to  the Southern Rebellion, nearly every American asserted with  Lafayette, "the sacred right of insurrection" or revolution, and  sympathized with insurrectionists, rebels, and revolutionists,  48 wherever they made their appearance.  Loyalty was held to be the  correlative of royalty, treason was regarded as a virtue, and  traitors were honored, feasted, and eulogized as patriots, ardent  lovers of liberty, and champions of the people.  The fearful  struggle of the nation against a rebellion which threatened its  very existence may have changed this.

That there is, or ever was, a state of nature such as the theory  assumes, may be questioned.  Certainly nothing proves that it is,  or ever was, a real state.  That there is a law of nature is  undeniable.  All authorities in philosophy, morals, politics, and  jurisprudence assert it; the state assumes it as its own  immediate basis, and the codes of all nations are founded on it;  universal jurisprudence, the jus qentium of the Romans, embodies  it, and the courts recognize and administer it.  It is the reason  and conscience of civil society, and every state acknowledges its  authority.  But the law of nature is as much in force in civil  society as out of it.  Civil law does not abrogate or supersede  natural law, but presupposes it, and supports itself on it as its  own ground and reason.  As the natural law, which is only natural  justice and equity dictated by the reason common to all men,  persists in the civil law, municipal or 49                                          international, as its  informing soul, so does the state of nature persist in the civil  state, natural society in civil society, which simply develops,  applies, and protects it.  Man in civil society is not out of  nature, but is in it--is in his most natural state; for society  is natural to him, and government is natural to society, and in  some form inseparable from it.  The state of nature under the  natural law is not, as a separate state, an actual state, and  never was; but an abstraction, in which is considered, apart from  the concrete existence called society, what is derived  immediately from the natural law.  But as abstractions have no  existence, out of the mind that forms them, the state of nature  has no actual existence in the world of reality as a separate  state.

But suppose with the theory the state of nature to have been a  real and separate state, in which men at first lived, there is  great difficulty in understanding how they ever got out of it.   Can a man divest himself of his nature, or lift himself above it?   Man is in his nature, and inseparable from it.  If his primitive  state was his natural state, and if the political state is  supernatural, preternatural, or subnatural, how passed he alone,  by his own unaided powers, from the former to the latter?  The  ancients,  50           who had lost the primitive tradition of creation,  asserted, indeed, the primitive man as springing from the earth,  and leading a mere animal life, living in eaves or hollow trees,  and feeding on roots and nuts, without speech, without science,  art, law, or sense of right and wrong; but prior to the  prevalence of the Epicurean philosophy, they never pretended,  that man could come out of that state alone by his own unaided  efforts.  They ascribed the invention of language, art, and  science, the institution of civil society, government, and laws,  to the intervention of the gods.  It remained for the  Epicureans--who, though unable, like their modern successors,  the Positivists or Developmentists, to believe in a first cause,  believed in effects without causes, or that things make or take  care of themselves--to assert that men could, by their own  unassisted efforts, or by the simple exercise of reason, come out  of the primitive state, and institute what in modern times is  called civilta, civility, or civilization.

The partisans of this theory of the state of nature from which  men have emerged by the voluntary and deliberate formation of  civil society, forget that if government is not the sole  condition, it is one of the essential conditions of progress.   The only progressive nations are 51                                  civilized or republican nations.   Savage and barbarous tribes are unprogressive.  Ages on ages roll  over them without changing any thing in their state; and Niebuhr  has well remarked with others, that history records no instance  of a savage tribe or people having become civilized by its own  spontaneous or indigenous efforts.  If savage tribes have ever  become civilized, it has been by influences from abroad, by the  aid of men already civilized, through conquest, colonies, or  missionaries; never by their own indigenous efforts, nor even by  commerce, as is so confidently asserted in this mercantile age.   Nothing in all history indicates the ability of a savage people  to pass of itself from the savage state to the civilized.  But  the primitive man, as described by Horace in his Satires, and  asserted by Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and others, is far below the  savage.  The lowest, most degraded, and most debased savage tribe  that has yet been discovered has at least some rude outlines or  feeble reminiscences of a social state, of government, morals,  law, and religion, for even in superstition the most gross there  is a reminiscence of true religion; but the people in the alleged  state of nature have none.

The advocates of the theory deceive themselves by transporting  into their imaginary 52                      state of nature the views, habits, and  capacities of the civilized man.  It is, perhaps, not difficult  for men who have been civilized, who have the intelligence, the  arts, the affections, and the habits of civilization, if deprived  by some great social convulsion of society, and thrown back on  the so-called state of nature, or cast away on some uninhabited  island in the ocean, and cut off from all intercourse with the  rest of mankind, to reconstruct civil society, and re-establish  and maintain civil government.  They are civilized men, and bear  civil society in their own life.  But these are no  representatives of the primitive man in the alleged state of  nature.  These primitive men have no experience, no knowledge, no  conception even of civilized life, or of any state superior to  that in which they have thus far lived.  How then can they,  since, on the theory, civil society has no root in nature, but is  a purely artificial creation, even conceive of civilization,  much less realize it?

These theorists, as theorists always do, fail to make a complete  abstraction of the civilized state, and conclude from what they  feel they could do in case civil society were broken up, what  men may do and have done in a state of nature.  Men cannot divest  themselves of 53               themselves, and, whatever their efforts to do it,  they think, reason, and act as they are.

Every writer, whatever else he writes, writes himself.  The  advocates of the theory, to have made their abstraction complete,  should have presented their primitive man as below the lowest  known savage, unprogressive, and in himself incapable of  developing any progressive energy.  Unprogressive, and, without  foreign assistance, incapable of progress, how is it possible for  your primitive man to pass, by his own unassisted efforts, from  the alleged state of nature to that of civilization, of which he  has no conception, and towards which no innate desire, no  instinct, no divine inspiration pushes him?

But even if, by some happy inspiration, hardly supposable without  supernatural intervention repudiated by the theory--if by some  happy inspiration, a rare individual should so far rise above the  state of nature as to conceive of civil society and of civil  government, how could he carry his conception into execution?   Conception is always easier than its realization, and between the  design and its execution there is always a weary distance.  The  poetry of all nations is a wail over unrealized ideals.  It is  little that even the wisest and most potent statesman can realize  of what he conceives to 54                         be necessary for the state: political,  legislative or judicial reforms, even when loudly demanded, and  favored by authority, are hard to be effected, and not seldom  generations come and go without effecting them.  The republics of  Plato, Sir Thomas More, Campanella, Harrington, as the  communities of Robert Owen and M. Cabet, remain Utopias, not  solely because intrinsically absurd, though so in fact, but  chiefly because they are innovations, have no support in  experience, and require for their realization the modes of  thought, habits, manners, character, life, which only their  introduction and realization can supply.  So to be able to  execute the design of passing from the supposed state of nature  to civilization, the reformer would need the intelligence, the  habits, and characters in the public which are not possible  without civilization itself.  Some philosophers suppose men have  invented language, forgetting that it requires language to give  the ability to invent language.

Men are little moved by mere reasoning, however clear and  convincing it may be.  They are moved by their affections,  passions, instincts, and habits.  Routine is more powerful with  them than logic.  A few are greedy of novelties, and are always  for trying experiments; 55                         but the great body of the people of all  nations have an invincible repugnance to abandon what they know  for what they know not.  They are, to a great extent, the slaves  of their own vis inertiae, and will not make the necessary  exertion to change their existing mode of life, even for a  better.  Interest itself is powerless before their indolence,  prejudice, habits, and usages.  Never were philosophers more  ignorant of human nature than they, so numerous in the last  century, who imagined that men can be always moved by a sense of  interest, and that enlightened self-interest, L'interet bien  entendu, suffices to found and sustain the state.  No reform, no  change in the constitution of government or of society, whatever  the advantages it may promise, can be successful, if introduced,  unless it has its root or germ in the past.  Man is never a  creator; he can only develop and continue, because he is himself  a creature, and only a second cause.  The children of Israel,  when they encountered the privations of the wilderness that lay  between them and the promised land flowing with milk and honey,  fainted in spirit, and begged Moses to lead them back to Egypt,  and permit them to return to slavery.

In the alleged state of nature, as the philosophers describe it,  there is no germ of civ- 56                        ilization, and the transition to civil  society would not be a development, but a complete rupture with  the past, and an entire new creation.  When it is with the  greatest difficulty that necessary reforms are introduced in old  and highly civilized nations and when it can seldom be done at  all without terrible political and social convulsions, how can we  suppose men without society, and knowing nothing of it, can  deliberately, and, as it were, with "malice aforethought," found  society?  Without government, and destitute alike of habits of  obedience and habits of command, how can they initiate,  establish, and sustain government?  To suppose it, would be to  suppose that men in a state of nature, without culture, without  science, without any of the arts, even the most simple and  necessary, are infinitely superior to the men formed under the  most advanced civilization.  Was Rousseau right in asserting  civilization as a fall, as a deterioration of the race?

But suppose the state of nature, even suppose that men, by some  miracle or other, can get out of it and found civil society, the  origin of government as authority in compact is not yet  established.  According to the theory, the rights of civil  society are derived from the rights of the individuals who form  or enter into 57               the compact.  But individuals cannot give what they  have not, and no individual has in himself the right to govern  another.  By the law of nature all men have equal rights, are  equals, and equals have no authority one over another.  Nor has  an individual the sovereign right even to himself, or the right  to dispose of himself as he pleases.  Man is not God,  independent, self-existing and self-sufficing.  He is dependent,  and dependent not only on his Maker, but on his fellow-men, on  society, and even on nature, or the material world.  That on  which he depends in the measure in which be depends on it,  contributes to his existence, to his life, and to his well-being,  and has, by virtue of its contribution, a right in him and to  him; and hence it is that nothing is more painful to the proud  spirit than to receive a favor that lays him under an obligation  to another.  The right of that on which man depends, and by  communion with which he lives, limits his own right over himself.

Man does not depend exclusively on society, for it is not his  only medium of communion with God, and therefore its right to him  is neither absolute nor unlimited; but still be depends on it,  lives in it, and cannot live without it.  It has, then, certain  lights over him, and 58                      he cannot enter into any compact, league, or  alliance that society does not authorize, or at least permit.   These rights of society override his rights to himself, and he  can neither surrender them nor delegate them.  Other rights, as  the rights of religion and property, which are held directly from  God and nature, and which are independent of society, are  included in what are called the natural rights of man; and these  rights cannot be surrendered in forming civil society, for they  are rights of man only before civil society, and therefore not  his to cede, and because they are precisely the rights that  government is bound to respect and protect.  The compact, then,  cannot be formed as pretended, for the only rights individuals  could delegate or surrender to society to constitute the sum of  the rights of government are hers already, and those which are  not hers are those which cannot be delegated or surrendered, and  in the free and full enjoyment of which, it is the duty, the  chief end of government to protect each and every individual.

The convention not only is not a fact, but individuals have no  authority without society, to meet in convention, and enter into  the alleged compact, because they are not independent, sovereign  individuals.  But pass over this: sup- 59                                      pose the convention, suppose  the compact, it must still be conceded that it binds and can bind  only those who voluntarily and deliberately enter into it.  This  is conceded by Mr. Jefferson and the American Congress of l776,  in the assertion that government derives its "just powers from  the consent of the governed."  This consent, as the matter is one  of life and death, must be free, deliberate, formal, explicit,  not simply an assumed, implied, or constructive consent.  It must  be given personally, and not by one for another without his  express authority.

It is usual to infer the consent or the acceptance of the terms  of the compact from the silence of the individual, and also from  his continued residence in the country and submission to its  government.  But residence is no evidence of consent, because it  may be a matter of necessity.  The individual may be unable to  emigrate, if he would; and by what right can individuals form an  agreement to which I must consent or else migrate to some strange  land?

Can my consent, under such circumstances, even if given, be any  thing but a forced consent, a consent given under duress, and  therefore invalid?  Nothing can be inferred from one's silence,  for he may have many reasons for being  60                                        silent besides approval of  the government.  He may be silent because speech would avail  nothing; because to protest might be dangerous--cost him his  liberty, if not his life; because he sees and knows nothing  better, and is ignorant that he has any choice in the case; or  because, as very likely is the fact with the majority, he has  never for moment thought of the matter, or ever had his attention  called to it, and has no mind on the subject.

But however this may be, there certainly must be excluded from  the compact or obligation to obey the government created by it  all the women of a nation, all the children too young to be  capable of giving their consent, and all who are too ignorant,  too weak of mind to be able to understand the terms of the  contract.  These several classes cannot be less than three-fourths  of the population of any country.  What is to be done with them?   Leave them without government?  Extend the power of the  government over them?  By what right?  Government derives its  just powers from the consent of the governed, and that consent  they have not given.  Whence does one-fourth of the population  get its right to govern the other three-fourths?

But what is to be done with the rights of 61                                           minorities?  Is the  rule of unanimity to be insisted on in the convention and in the  government, when it goes into operation?  Unanimity is  impracticable, for where there are many men there will be  differences of opinion.  The rule of unanimity gives to each  individual a veto on the whole proceeding, which was the grand  defect of the Polish constitution.  Each member of the Polish  Diet, which included the whole body of the nobility, had an  absolute veto, and could, alone, arrest the whole action of the  government.  Will you substitute the rule of the majority, and  say the majority must govern?  By what right?  It is agreed to in  the convention.  Unanimously, or only by a majority?  The right  of the majority to have their will is, on the social compact  theory, a conventional right, and therefore cannot come into play  before the convention is completed, or the social compact is  framed and accepted.  How, in settling the terms of the compact,  will you proceed?  By majorities?  But suppose a minority  objects, and demands two-thirds, three-fourths, or four-fifths,  and votes against the majority rule, which is carried only by a  simple plurality of votes, will the proceedings of the convention  bind the dissenting minority? 62                                What gives to the majority the  right to govern the minority who dissent from its action?

On the supposition that society has rights not derived from  individuals, and which are intrusted to the government, there is  a good reason why the majority should prevail within the  legitimate sphere of government, because the majority is the best  representative practicable of society itself; and if the  constitution secures to minorities and dissenting individuals  their natural rights and their equal rights as citizens, they  have no just cause of complaint, for the majority in such case  has no power to tyrannize over them or to oppress them.  But the  theory under examination denies that society has any rights  except such as it derives from individuals who all have equal  rights.  According to it, society is itself conventional, and  created by free, independent, equal, sovereign individuals.   Society is a congress of sovereigns, in which no one has  authority over another, and no one can be rightfully forced to  submit to any decree against his will.  In such a congress the  rule of the majority is manifestly improper, illegitimate, and  invalid, unless adopted by unanimous consent.

But this is not all.  The individual is always the equal of  himself, and if the government 63                                derives its powers from the  consent of the governed, he governs in the government, and parts  with none of his original sovereignty.  The government is not his  master, but his agent, as the principal only delegates, not  surrenders, his rights and powers to the agent.  He is free at  any time he pleases to recall the powers he has delegated, to  give new instructions, or to dismiss him.  The sovereignty of the  individual survives the compact, and persists through all the  acts of his agent, the government.  He must, then, be free to  withdraw from the compact whenever be judges it advisable.   Secession is perfectly legitimate if government is simply a  contract between equals.  The disaffected, the criminal, the  thief the government would send to prison, or the murderer it  would hang, would be very likely to revoke his consent, and to  secede from the state.  Any number of individuals large enough to  count a majority among themselves, indisposed to pay the  government taxes, or to perform the military service exacted,  might hold a convention, adopt a secession ordinance, and declare  themselves a free, independent, sovereign state, and bid defiance  to the tax-collector and the provost-marshall, and that, too,  without forfeiting their estates or changing their domicile.   Would 64       the government employ military force to coerce them back to  their allegiance?  By what right?  Government is their agent,  their creature, and no man owes allegiance to his own agent, or  creature.

The compact could bind only temporarily, and could at any moment  be dissolved.  Mr. Jefferson saw this, and very consistently  maintained that one generation has no power to bind another; and,  as if this was not enough, he asserted the right of revolution,  and gave it as his opinion that in every nation a revolution once  in every generation is desirable, that is, according to his  reckoning, once every nineteen years.  The doctrine that one  generation has no power to bind its successor is not only a  logical conclusion from the theory that governments derive their  just powers from the consent of the governed, since a generation  cannot give its consent before it is born, but is very convenient  for a nation that has contracted a large national debt; yet,  perhaps, not so convenient to the public creditor, since the new  generation may take it into its head not to assume or discharge  the obligations of its predecessor, but to repudiate them.  No  man, certainly, can contract for any one but himself; and how  then can the son be bound, without his own personal or 65                                                        individual  consent, freely given, by the obligations entered into by his  father?

The social compact is necessarily limited to the individuals who  form it, and as necessarily, unless renewed, expires with them.   It thus creates no state, no political corporation, which  survives in all its rights and powers, though individuals die.   The state is on this theory a voluntary association, and in  principle, except that it is not a secret society, in no respect  differs from the Carbonari, or the Knights of the Golden Circle.   When Orsini attempted to execute the sentence of death on the  Emperor of the French, in obedience to the order of the  Carbonari, of which the Emperor was a member, he was, if the  theory of the origin of government in compact be true, no more an  assassin than was the officer who executed on the gallows the  rebel spies and incendiaries Beal and Kennedy.

Certain it is that the alleged social compact has in it no social  or civil element.  It does not and cannot create society.  It can  give only an aggregation of individuals, and society is not an  aggregation nor even an organization of individuals.  It is an  organism, and individuals live in its life as well as it in  theirs.  There is a real living solidarity, which makes  individuals members of the social body, and members one 66                                                         of another.   There is no society without individuals, and there are no  individuals without society; but in society there is that which  is not individual, and is more than all individuals.  The social  compact is an attempt to substitute for this real living  solidarity, which gives to society at once unity of life and  diversity of members, an artificial solidarity, a fictitious  unity for a real unity, and membership by contract for real  living membership, a cork leg for that which nature herself gives.   Real government has its ground in this real living solidarity,  and represents the social element, which is not individual, but  above all individuals, as man is above men.  But the theory  substitutes a simple agency for government, and makes each  individual its principal.  It is an abuse of language to call  this agency a government.  It has no one feature or element of  government.  It has only an artificial unity, based on diversity;  its authority is only personal, individual, and in no sense a  public authority, representing a public will, a public right, or  a public interest.  In no country could government be adopted and  sustained if men were left to the wisdom or justness of their  theories, or in the general affairs of life, acted on them.   Society, and government as representing society, has a real  existence, life, facul- 67                       ties, and organs of its own, not derived or  derivable from individuals.  As well might it be maintained that  the human body consists in and derives all its life from the  particles of matter it assimilates from its food, and which are  constantly escaping as to maintain that society derives its life,  or government its powers, from individuals.  No mechanical  aggregation of brute matter can make a living body, if there is  no living and assimilating principle within; and no aggregation  of individuals, however closely bound together by pacts or oaths,  can make society where there is no informing social principle  that aggregates and assimilates them to a living body, or produce  that mystic existence called a state or commonwealth.

The origin of government in the Contrat Social supposes the  nation to be a purely personal affair.  It gives the government  no territorial status, and clothes it with no territorial rights  or jurisdiction.  The government that could so originate would be,  if any thing, a barbaric, not a republican government.  It has  only the rights conferred on it, surrendered or delegated to it  by individuals, and therefore, at best, only individual rights.   Individuals can confer only such rights as they have in the  supposed state of nature.  In that state there is  68 neither private nor public domain.  The earth in  that state is not property, and is open to the first occupant,  and the occupant can lay no claim to any more than he actually  occupies.  Whence, then, does government derive its territorial  jurisdiction, and its right of eminent domain claimed by all  national governments?  Whence its title to vacant or unoccupied  lands?  How does any particular government fix its territorial  boundaries, and obtain the right to prescribe who may occupy, and  on what conditions the vacant lands within those boundaries?   Whence does it get its jurisdiction of navigable rivers, lakes,  bays, and the seaboard within its territorial limits, as  appertaining to its domain?  Here are rights that it could not  have derived from individuals, for individuals never possessed  them in the so-called state of nature.  The concocters of the  theory evidently overlooked these rights, or considered them of  no importance.  They seem never to have contemplated the  existence of territorial states, or the division of mankind into  nations fixed to the soil.  They seem not to have supposed the  earth could be appropriated; and, indeed, many of their followers  pretend that it cannot be, and that the public lands of a nation  are open lands, and whoso chooses may occupy 69                                              them, without leave  asked of the national authority or granted.  The American people  retain more than one reminiscence of the nomadic and predatory  habits of their Teutonic or Scythian ancestors before they  settled on the banks of the Don or the Danube, on the Northern  Ocean, in Scania, or came in contact with the Graeco-Roman  civilization.

Yet mankind are divided into nations, and all civilized nations  are fixed to the soil.  The territory is defined, and is the  domain of the state, from which all private proprietors hold  their title-deeds.  Individual proprietors hold under the state,  and often hold more, than they occupy; but it retains in all  private estates the eminent domain, and prohibits the alienation  of land to one who is not a citizen.  It defends its domain, its  public unoccupied lauds, and the lands owned by private  individuals, against all foreign powers.  Now whence, if  government has only the rights ceded it by individuals, does it  get this domain, and hold the right to treat settlers on even  its unoccupied lands as trespassers?  In the state of nature the  territorial rights of individuals, if any they have, are  restricted to the portion of land they occupy with their rude  culture, and with their flocks and herds, and in civilized  nations to what they 70                      hold from the state, and, therefore, the  right as held and defended by all nations, and without which the  nation has no status, no fixed dwelling, and is and can be no  state, could never have been derived from individuals.  The  earliest notices of Rome show the city in possession of the  sacred territory, to which the state and all political power are  attached.  Whence did Rome become a landholder, and the  governing people a territorial people?  Whence does any nation  become a territorial nation and lord of the domain?  Certainly  never by the cession of individuals, and hence no civilized  government ever did or could originate in the so-called social  compact.





71 CHAPTER V.

ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT-CONTINUED.


III. The tendency of the last century was to individualism; that  of the present is to socialism.  The theory of Hobbes, Locke,  Rousseau, and Jefferson, though not formally abandoned, and still  held by many, has latterly been much modified, if not wholly  transformed.  Sovereignty, it is now maintained, is inherent in  the people; not individually, indeed, but collectively, or the  people as society.  The constitution is held not to be simply a  compact or agreement entered into by the people as individuals  creating civil society and government, but a law ordained by the  sovereign people, prescribing the constitution of the state and  defining its rights and powers.

This transformation, which is rather going on than completed, is,  under one aspect at least, a progress, or rather a return to the  sounder principles of antiquity.  Under it government ceases to  be a mere agency, which must obtain  72                                     the assassin's consent to be  hung before it can rightfully hang him, and becomes authority,  which is one and imperative.  The people taken collectively are  society, and society is a living organism, not a mere aggregation  of individuals.  It does not, of course, exist without  individuals, but it is something more than individuals, and has  rights not derived from them, and which are paramount to theirs.   There is more truth, and truth of a higher order, in this than in  the theory of the social compact.  Individuals, to a certain  extent, derive their life from God through society, and so far  they depend on her, and they are hers; she owns them, and has the  right to do as she will with them.  On this theory the state  emanates from society, and is supreme.  It coincides with the  ancient Greek and Roman theory, as expressed by Cicero, already  cited.  Man is born in society and remains there, and it may be  regarded as the source of ancient Greek and Roman patriotism,  which still commands the admiration of the civilized world.  The  state with Greece and Rome was a living reality, and loyalty a  religion.  The Romans held Rome to be a divinity, gave her  statues and altars, and offered her divine worship.  This was  superstition, no doubt, but it had in it an ele- 73                                                ment of truth.  To  every true philosopher there is something divine in the state,  and truth in all theories.  Society stands nearer to God, and  participates more immediately of the Divine essence, and the  state is a more lively image of God than the individual.  It was  man, the generic and reproductive man, not the isolated  individual, that was created in the image and likeness of his  Maker.  "And God created man in his own image; in the image of  God created he him; male and female created he them."

This theory is usually called the democratic theory, and it  enlists in its support the instincts, the intelligence, the  living forces, and active tendencies of the age.  Kings, kaisers,  and hierarchies are powerless before it, and war against it in  vain.  The most they can do is to restrain its excesses, or to  guard against its abuses.  Its advocates, in returning to it,  sometimes revive in its name the old pagan superstition.  Not a  few of the European democrats recognize in the earth, in heaven,  or in hell, no power superior to the people, and say not only people-king but people-God.  They say absolutely, without any  qualification, the voice of the people is the voice of God, and  make their will the supreme law, not only in politics, but in  religion, philosophy, morals, science, and the 74                                                arts.  The people  not only found the state, but also the church.  They inspire or  reveal the truth, ordain or prohibit worships, judge of  doctrines, and decide cases of conscience.  Mazzini said , when  at the bead of the Roman Republic in 1848, the question of  religion must be remitted to the judgment of the people.  Yet  this theory is the dominant theory of the age, and is in all  civilized nations advancing with apparently irresistible force.

But this theory has its difficulties.  Who are the collective  people that have the rights of society, or, who are the sovereign  people?  The word people is vague, and in itself determines  nothing.  It may include a larger or a smaller number; it may  mean the political people, or it may mean simply population; it  may mean peasants, artisans, shopkeepers, traders, merchants, as  distinguished from the nobility; hired laborers or workmen as  distinguished from their employer, or slaves as distinguished  from their master or owner.  In which of these senses is the word  to be taken when it is said, "The people are sovereign?"  The  people are the population or inhabitants of one and the same  country.  That is something.  But who or what determines the  country?  Is the country the whole territory of the globe?  That  will 75      not be said, especially since the dispersion of mankind and  their division into separate nations.  Is the territory  indefinite or undefined?  Then indefinite or undefined are its  inhabitants, or the people invested with the rights of society.   Is it defined and its boundaries fixed?  Who has done it?  The  people.  But who are the people?  We are as wise as we were at  starting.  The logicians say that the definition of idem per  idem, or the same by the same, is simply no definition at all.

The people are the nation, undoubtedly, if you mean by the people  the sovereign people.  But who are the people constituting the  nation?  The sovereign people?  This is only to revolve in a  vicious circle.  The nation is the tribe or the people living  under the same regimen, and born of the same ancestor, or sprung  from the same ancestor or progenitor.  But where find a nation in  this the primitive sense of the word?  Migration, conquest, and  intermarriage, have so broken up and intermingled the primitive  races, that it is more than doubtful if a single nation, tribe,  or family of unmixed blood now exists on the face of the earth.   A Frenchman, Italian, Spaniard, German, or Englishman, may have  the blood of a hundred different races coursing in his veins.   The nation is the people 76                          inhabiting the same country, and united  under one and the same government, it is further answered.  The  nation, then, is not purely personal, but also territorial.   Then, again, the question comes up, who or what determines the  territory?  The government?  But not before it is constituted,  and it cannot be constituted till its territorial limits are  determined.  The tribe doubtless occupies territory, but is not  fixed to it, and derives no jurisdiction from it, and therefore  is not territorial.  But a nation, in the modern or civilized  sense, is fixed to the territory, and derives from it its  jurisdiction, or sovereignty; and, therefore, till the territory  is determined, the nation is not and cannot be determined.

The question is not an idle question.  It is one of great  practical importance; for, till it is settled, we can neither  determine who are the sovereign people, nor who are united under  one and the same government.  Laws have no extra-territorial  force, and the officer who should attempt to enforce the national  laws beyond the national territory would be a trespasser.  If the  limits are undetermined, the government is not territorial, and  can claim as within its jurisdiction only those who choose to  acknowledge its authority.  The importance of the question has 77 been recently brought home to the American people by the  secession of eleven or more States from the Union.  Were these  States a part of the American nation, or were they not?  Was the  war which followed secession, and which cost so many lives and so  much treasure, a civil war or a foreign war?  Were the  secessionists traitors and rebels to their sovereign, or were  they patriots fighting for the liberty and independence of their  country and the right of self-government?  All on both sides  agreed that the nation is sovereign; the dispute was as to the  existence of the nation itself, and the extent of its  jurisdiction.  Doubtless, when a nation has a generally  recognized existence as an historical fact, most of the  difficulties in determining who are the sovereign people can be  got over; but the question here concerns the institution of  government, and determining who constitute society and have the  right to meet in person, or by their delegates in convention,  to institute it.  This question, so important, and at times so  difficult, the theory of the origin of government in the people  collectively, or the nation, does not solve, or furnish any means  of solving.

But suppose this difficulty surmounted there is still another,  and a very grave one, to over- 78                              come.  The theory assumes that the  people collectively, "in their own native right and might," are  sovereign.  According to it the people are ultimate, and free to  do whatever they please.  This sacrifices individual freedom.   The origin of government in a compact entered into by  individuals, each with all and all with each, sacrificed the  rights of society, and assumed each individual to be in himself  an independent sovereignty.  If logically carried out, there  could be no such crime as treason, there could be no state, and  no public authority.  This new theory transfers to society the  sovereignty which that asserted for the individual, and asserts  social despotism, or the absolutism of the state.  It asserts  with sufficient energy public authority, or the right of the  people to govern; but it leaves no space for individual rights,  which society must recognize, respect, and protect.  This was the  grand defect of the ancient Graeco-Roman civilization.  The  historian explores in vain the records of the old Greek and Roman  republics for any recognition of the rights of individuals not  held as privileges or concessions from the state.  Society  recognized no limit to her authority, and the state claimed over  individuals all the authority of the patriarch over his  household, 79            the chief over his tribe, or the absolute monarch over  his subjects.  The direct and indirect influence of the body of  freemen admitted to a voice in public affairs, in determining the  resolutions and action of the state, no doubt tempered in  practice to some extent the authority of the state, and prevented  acts of gross oppression; but in theory the state was absolute,  and the people individually were placed at the mercy of the  people collectively, or, rather, the majority of the collective  people.

Under ancient republicanism, there were rights of the state and  rights of the citizen, but no rights of man, held independently  of society, and not derived from God through the state.  The  recognition of these rights by modern society is due to  Christianity: some say to the barbarians, who overthrew the Roman  empire; but this last opinion is not well founded.  The barbarian  chiefs and nobles had no doubt a lively sense of personal freedom  and independence, but for themselves only.  They had no  conception of personal freedom as a general or universal right,  and men never obtain universal principles by generalizing  particulars.  They may give a general truth a particular  application, but not a particular truth--understood to be a  particular truth--a general or universal 80                                          application.  They are  too good logicians for that.  The barbarian individual freedom  and personal independence was never generalized into the doctrine  of the rights of man, any more than the freedom of the master has  been generalized into the right of his slaves to be free.  The  doctrine of individual freedom before the state is due to the  Christian religion, which asserts the dignity and worth of every  human soul, the accountability to God of each man for himself,  and lays it down as law for every one that God is to be obeyed  rather than men.  The church practically denied the absolutism of  the state, and asserted for every man rights not held from the  state, in converting the empire to Christianity, in defiance of  the state authority, and the imperial edicts punishing with death  the profession of the Christian faith.  In this she practically,  as well as theoretically, overthrew state absolutism, and infused  into modern society the doctrine that every individual, even the  lowest and meanest, has rights which the state neither confers  nor can abrogate; and it will only be by extinguishing in modern  society the Christian faith, and obliterating all traces of  Christian civilization, that state absolutism can be revived with  more than a partial and temporary success.

81 The doctrine of individual liberty may be abused, and so  explained as to deny the rights of society, and to become pure  individualism; but no political system that runs to the opposite  extreme, and absorbs the individual in the state, stands the  least chance of any general or permanent success till  Christianity is extinguished.  Yet the assertion of principles  which logically imply state absolutism is not entirely harmless,  even in Christian countries.  Error is never harmless, and only  truth can give a solid foundation on which to build.   Individualism and socialism are each opposed to the other, and  each has only a partial truth.  The state founded on either  cannot stand, and society will only alternate between the two  extremes.  To-day it is torn by a revolution in favor of  socialism; to-morrow it will be torn by another in favor of  individualism, and without effecting any real progress by either  revolution.  Real progress can be secured only by recognizing and  building on the truth, not as it exists in our opinions or in our  theories, but as it exists in the world of reality, and  independent of our opinions.

Now, social despotism or state absolutism is not based on truth  or reality.  Society has certain rights over individuals, for she  is a 82      medium of their communion with God, or through which they  derive life from God, the primal source of all life; but she is  not the only medium of man's life.  Man, as was said in the  beginning, lives by communion with God, and he communes with God  in the creative act and the Incarnation, through his kind, and,  through nature.  This threefold communion gives rise to three  institutions--religion or the church, society or the state, and  property.  The life that man derives from God through religion  and property, is not derived from him through society, and  consequently so much of his life be holds independently of  society; and this constitutes his rights as a man as  distinguished from his rights as a citizen.  In relation to  society, as not held from God through her, these are termed his  natural rights, which, she must hold inviolable, and government  protect for every one, whatever his complexion or his social  position.  These rights--the rights of conscience and the rights  of property, with all their necessary implications--are  limitations of the rights of society, and the individual has the  right to plead them against the state.  Society does not confer  them, and it cannot take them away, for they are at least as  sacred and as fundamental as her own.

83 But even this limitation of popular sovereignty is not all.  The  people can be sovereign only in the sense in which they exist and  act.  The people are not God, whatever some theorists may  pretend--are not independent, self-existent, and self-sufficing.   They are as dependent collectively as individually, and therefore  can exist and act only as second cause, never as first cause.   They can, then, even in the limited sphere of their sovereignty,  be sovereign only in a secondary sense, never absolute sovereign  in their own independent right.  They are sovereign only to the  extent to which they impart life to the individual members of  society, and only in the sense in which she imparts it, or is its  cause.  She is not its first cause or creator, and is the medial  cause or medium through which they derive it from God, not its  efficient cause or primary source.  Society derives her own life  from God, and exists and acts only as dependent on him.  Then she  is sovereign over individuals only as dependent on God.  Her  dominion is then not original and absolute, but secondary and  derivative.

This third theory does not err in assuming that the people  collectively are more than the people individually, or in denying  society to be a mere aggregation of individuals with no life,  84                                                               and  no rights but what it derives from them; nor even in asserting  that the people in the sense of society are sovereign, but in  asserting that they are sovereign in their own native or  underived right and might.  Society has not in herself the  absolute right to govern, because she has not the absolute  dominion either of herself or her members.  God gave to man  dominion over the irrational creation, for he made irrational  creatures for man; but he never gave him either individually or  collectively the dominion over the rational creation.  The theory  that the people are absolutely sovereign in their own independent  right and might, as some zealous democrats explain it, asserts  the fundamental principle of despotism, and all despotism is  false, for it identifies the creature with the Creator.  No  creature is creator, or has the rights of creator, and  consequently no one in his own right is or can be sovereign.   This third theory, therefore, is untenable.

IV. A still more recent class of philosophers, if philosophers  they may be called, reject the origin of government in the people  individually or collectively.  Satisfied that it has never been  instituted by a voluntary and deliberate act of the people, and  confounding government as a 85                             fact with government as authority,  maintain that government is a spontaneous development of nature.   Nature develops it as the liver secretes bile, as the bee  constructs her cell, or the beaver builds his dam.  Nature,  working by her own laws and inherent energy, develops society,  and society develops government.  That is all the secret.   Questions as to the origin of government or its rights, beyond  the simple positive fact, belong to the theological or  metaphysical stage of the development of nature, but are left  behind when the race has passed beyond that stage, and has  reached the epoch of positive science, in which all, except the  positive fact, is held to be unreal and non-existent.   Government, like every thing else in the universe, is simply a  positive development of nature.  Science explains the laws and  conditions of the development, but disdains to ask for its origin  or ground in any order that transcends the changes of the world  of space and time.

These philosophers profess to eschew all theory, and yet they  only oppose theory to theory.  The assertion that reality for the  human mind is restricted to the positive facts of the sensible  order, is purely theoretic, and is any thing but a positive fact.   Principles are as really objects of science as facts, and it is  only 86      in the light of principles that facts themselves are  intelligible.  If the human mind had no science of reality that  transcends the sensible order, or the positive fact, it could  have no science at all.  As things exist only in their principles  or causes, so can they be known only in their principles and  causes; for things can be known only as they are, or as they  really exist.  The science that pretends to deduce principles  from particular facts, or to rise from the fact by way of  reasoning to an order that transcends facts, and in which facts  have their origin, is undoubtedly chimerical, and as against that  the positivists are unquestionably right.  But to maintain that  man has no intelligence of any thing beyond the fact, no  intuition or intellectual apprehension of its principle or cause,  is equally chimerical.  The human mind cannot have all science,  but it has real science as far as it goes, and real science is  the knowledge of things as they are, not as they are not.   Sensible facts are not intelligible by themselves, because they  do not exist by themselves; and if the human mind could not  penetrate beyond the individual fact, beyond the mimetic to the  methexic, or transcendental principle, copied or imitated by the  individual fact, it could never know the fact itself.  The error  of modern 87           philosophers, or philosopherlings, is in supposing the  principle is deduced or inferred from the fact, and in denying  that the human mind has direct and immediate intuition of it.

Something that transcends the sensible order there must be, or  there could be no development; and if we had no science of it, we  could never assert that development is development, or  scientifically explain the laws and conditions of development.   Development is explication, and supposes a germ which precedes  it, and is not itself a development; and development, however far  it may be carried, can never do more than realize the  possibilities of the germ.  Development is not creation, and  cannot supply its own germ.  That at least must be given by the  Creator, for from nothing nothing can be developed.  If authority  has not its germ in nature, it cannot be developed from nature  spontaneously or otherwise.  All government has a governing will;  and without a will that commands, there is no government; and  nature has in her spontaneous developments no will, for she has  no personality.  Reason itself, as distinguished from will, only  presents the end and the means, but does not govern; it  prescribes a rule, but cannot ordain a law.  An imperative will,  the will of a superior who has the right to 88                                             command what reason  dictates or approves, is essential to government; and that will  is not developed from nature, because it has no germ in nature.   So something above and beyond nature must be asserted, or  government itself cannot be asserted, even as a development.   Nature is no more self-sufficing than are the people, or than is  the individual man.

No doubt there is a natural law, which is law in the proper sense  of the word law; but this is a positive law under which nature is  placed by a sovereign above herself, and is never to be  confounded with those laws of nature so-called, according to  which she is productive as second cause, or produces her effects,  which are not properly laws at all.  Fire burns, water flows,  rain falls, birds fly, fishes swim, food nourishes, poisons kill,  one substance has a chemical affinity for another, the needle  points to the pole, by a natural law, it is said; that is, the  effects are produced by an inherent and uniform natural force.   Laws in this sense are simply physical forces, and are nature  herself.  The natural law, in an ethical sense, is not a physical  law, is not a natural force, but a law impose by the Creator on  all moral creatures, that is, all creatures endowed with reason  and free-will, and is called natural because promul- 89                                                    gated in  natural reason, or the reason common and essential to all moral  creatures.  This is the moral law.  It is what the French call le  droit naturell, natural right, and, as the theologians teach us,  is the transcript of the eternal law, the eternal will or reason  of God.  It is the foundation of all law, and all acts of a state  that contravene it are, as St. Augustine maintains, violences  rather than laws.  The moral law is no development of nature, for  it is above nature, and is imposed on nature.  The only  development there is about it is in our understanding of it.

There is, of course, development in nature, for nature considered  as creation has been created in germ, and is completed only in  successive developments.  Hence the origin of space and time.   There would have been no space if there had been no external  creation, and no time if the creation had been completed  externally at once, as it was in relation to the Creator.  Ideal  space is simply the ability of God to externize his creative act,  and actual space is the relation of coexistence in the things  created; ideal time is the ability of God to create existences  with the capacity of being completed by successive developments,  and actual time is the relation of these in the order of  90 succession, and when the existence is completed or consummated  development ceases, and time is no more.  In relation to himself  the Creator's works are complete from the first, and hence with  him there is no time, for there is no succession.  But in  relation to itself creation is incomplete, and there is room for  development, which may be continued till the whole possibility of  creation is actualized.  Here is the foundation of what is true  in the modern doctrine of progress.  Man is progressive, because  the possibilities of his nature are successively unfolded and  actualized.

Development is a fact, and its laws and conditions may be  scientifically ascertained and defined.  All generation is  development, as is all growth, physical, moral, or intellectual.   But everything is developed in its own order, and after its kind.   The Darwinian theory of the development of species is not  sustained by science. The development starts from the germ, and	 in the germ is given the law or principle of the development.   >From the acorn is developed the oak, never the pine or the  linden.  Every kind generates its kind, never another.  But no  development is, strictly speaking, spontaneous, or the result  alone of the inherent energy or force of the germ developed. 91 There is not only a solidarity of race, but in some sense of all  races, or species; all created things are bound to their Creator,  and to one another.  One and the same law or principle of life  pervades all creation, binding the universe together in a unity  that copies or imitates the unity of the Creator.  No creature is  isolated from the rest, or absolutely independent of others.  All  are parts of one stupendous whole, and each depends on the whole,  and the whole on each, and each on each.  All creatures are  members of one body, and members one of another.  The germ of the  oak is in the acorn, but the acorn left to itself alone can never  grow into the oak, any more than a body at rest can place itself  in motion.  Lay the acorn away in your closet, where it is  absolutely deprived of air, heat, and moisture, and in vain will  you watch for its germination.  Germinate it cannot without some  external influence, or communion, so to speak, with the elements  from which it derives its sustenance and support.

There can be no absolutely spontaneous development.  All things  are doubtless active, for nothing exists except in so far as it  is an active force of some sort; but only God himself alone  suffices for his own activity.  All created things are dependent,  have not their being  92                      in themselves, and are real only as they  participate, through the creative act, of the Divine being.  The  germ can no more be developed than it could exist without God,  and no more develop itself than it could create itself.  What is  called the law of development is in the germ; but that law or  force can operate only in conjunction with another force or other  forces.  All development, as all growth, is by accretion or  assimilation.  The assimilating force is, if you will, in the  germ, but the matter assimilated comes and must come from abroad.   Every herdsman knows it, and knows that to rear his stock he must  supply them with appropriate food; every husbandman knows it, and  knows that to raise a crop of corn, be must plant the seed in a  soil duly prepared, and which will supply the gases needed for  its germination, growth, flowering, boiling, and ripening.  In  all created things, in all things not complete in themselves, in  all save God, in whom there is no development possible, for He  is, as say the schoolmen, most pure act, in whom there is no  unactualized possibility, the same law holds good.  Development  is always the resultant of two factors, the one the thing itself,  the other some external force co-operating with it, exciting  it, and aiding it to act. 93 Hence the praemotio physica of the Thomists, and the praevenient  and adjuvant grace of the theologians, without which no one can  begin the Christian life, and which must needs be supernatural  when the end is supernatural.  The principle of life in all  orders is the same, and human activity no more suffices for  itself in one order than in another.

Here is the reason why the savage tribe never rises to a  civilized state without communion in some form with a people  already civilized, and why there is no moral or intellectual  development and progress without education and instruction,  consequently without instructors and educators.  Hence the value  of tradition; and hence, as the first man could not instruct  himself, Christian theologians, with a deeper philosophy than is  dreamed of by the sciolists of the age, maintain that God himself  was man's first teacher, or that he created Adam a full-grown  man, with all his faculties developed, complete, and in full  activity.  Hence, too, the heathen mythologies, which always  contain some elements of truth, however they may distort,  mutilate, or travesty them, make the gods the first teachers of  the human race, and ascribe to their instruction even the most  simple and ordinary arts of every-day life. 94                                             The gods teach men to  plough, to plant, to reap, to work in iron, to erect a shelter  from the storm, and to build a fire to warm them and to cook  their food.  The common sense, as well as the common traditions  of mankind, refuses to accept the doctrine that men are developed  without foreign aid, or progressive without divine assistance.   Nature of herself can no more develop government than it can  language.  There can be no language without society, and no  society without language.  There can be no government without  society, and no society without government of some sort.

But even if nature could spontaneously develop herself, she could  never develop an institution that has the right to govern, for  she has not herself that right.  Nature is not God, has not  created us, therefore has not the right of property in us.  She  is not and cannot be our sovereign.  We belong not to her, nor  does she belong to herself, for she is herself creature, and  belongs to her Creator.  Not being in herself sovereign, she  cannot develop the right to govern, nor can she develop  government as a fact, to say nothing of its right, for  government, whether we speak of it as fact or as authority, is  distinct from that which is governed; but natural de- 95                                                     velopments  are nature, and indistinguishable from her.  The governor and the  governed, the restrainer and the restrained, can never as such be  identical.  Self-government, taken strictly, is a contradiction  in terms.  When an individual is said to govern himself, he is  never understood to govern himself in the sense in which be is  governed.  He by his reason and will governs or restrains his  appetites and passions.  It is man as spirit governing man as  flesh, the spiritual mind governing the carnal mind.

Natural developments cannot in all cases be even allowed to take  their own course without injury to nature herself.  "Follow  nature" is an unsafe maxim, if it means, leave nature to develop  herself as she will, and follow thy natural inclinations.  Nature  is good, but inclinations are frequently bad.  All our appetites  and passions are given us for good, for a purpose useful and  necessary to individual and social life, but they become morbid  and injurious if indulged without restraint.  Each has its  special object, and naturally seeks it exclusively, and thus  generates discord and war in the individual, which immediately  find expression in society, and also in the state, if the state  be a simple natural development.  The Christian maxim, 96                                                        Deny  thyself, is far better than the Epicurean maxim, Enjoy thyself,  for there is no real enjoyment without self-denial.  There is  deep philosophy in Christian asceticism, as the Positivists  themselves are aware, and even insist.  But Christian asceticism  aims not to destroy nature, as voluptuaries pretend, but to  regulate, direct, and restrain its abnormal developments for its  own good.  It forces nature in her developments to submit to a  law which is not in her, but above her.  The Positivists pretend  that this asceticism is itself a natural development, but that  cannot be a natural development which directs, controls, and  restrains natural development.

The Positivists confound nature at one time with the law of  nature, and at another the law of nature with nature herself, and  take what is called the natural law to be a natural development.   Here is their mistake, as it is the mistake of all who accept  naturalistic theories.  Society, no doubt, is authorized by the  law of nature to institute and maintain government.  But the law  of nature is not a natural development, nor is it in nature, or  any part of nature.  It is not a natural force which operates in  nature, and which is the developing principle of nature.  Do they  say reason is natural, and the law of 97                                       nature is only reason?   This is not precisely the fact.  The natural law is law proper,  and is reason only in the sense that reason includes both  intellect and will, and nobody can pretend that nature in her  spontaneous developments acts from intelligence and volition.   Reason, as the faculty of knowing, is subjective and natural; but  in the sense in which it is coincident with the natural law, it  is neither subjective nor natural, but objective and divine, and  is God affirming himself and promulgating his law to his  creature, man.  It is, at least, an immediate participation of  the divine by which He reveals himself and His will to the human  understanding, and is not natural, but supernatural, in the sense  that God himself is supernatural.  This is wherefore reason is  law, and every man is bound to submit or conform to reason.

That legitimate governments are instituted under the natural law  is frankly conceded, but this is by no means the concession of  government as a natural development.  The reason and will of  which the natural law is the expression are the reason and will  of God.  The natural law is the divine law as much as the  revealed law itself, and equally obligatory.  It is not a natural  force developing itself in na- 98                              ture, like the law of generation,  for instance, and therefore proceeding from God as first cause,  but it proceeds from God as final cause, and is, therefore,  theological, and strictly a moral law, founding moral rights and  duties.  Of course, all morality and all legitimate government  rest on this law, or, if you will, originate in it.  But not  therefore in nature, but in the Author of nature.  The authority  is not the authority of nature, but of Him who holds nature in  the hollow of His hand.

V. In the seventeenth century a class of political writers who  very well understood that no creature, no man, no number of men,  not even, nature herself, can be inherently sovereign, defended  the opinion that governments are founded, constituted, and  clothed with their authority by the direct and express  appointment of God himself.  They denied that rulers hold their  power from the nation; that, however oppressive may be their  rule, that they are justiciable by any human tribunal, or that  power, except by the direct judgment of God, is amissible.  Their  doctrine is known in history as the doctrine of "the divine right  of kings, and passive obedience."  All power, says St. Paul, is  from God, and the powers that be are ordained of God, and to  resist them is to resist 99                          the ordination of God.  They must be  obeyed for conscience' sake.

It would, perhaps, be rash to say that this doctrine had never  been broached before the seventeenth century, but it received in  that century, and chiefly in England, its fullest and most  systematic developments.  It was patronized by the Anglican  divines, asserted by James I. of England, and lost the Stuarts  the crown of three kingdoms.  It crossed the Channel, into  France, where it found a few hesitating and stammering defenders  among Catholics, under Louis XIV., but it has never been very  generally held, though it has had able and zealous supporters.   In England it was opposed by all the Presbyterians, Puritans,  Independents, and Republicans, and was forgotten or abandoned by  the Anglican divines themselves in the Revolution of 1688, that  expelled James II. and crowned William and Mary.  It was ably  refuted by the Jesuit Suarez in his reply to a Remonstrance for  the Divine Right of Kings by the James I.; and a Spanish monk who  had asserted it in Madrid, under Philip II., was compelled by the  Inquisition to retract it publicly in the place where he had  asserted it.  All republicans reject it, and the Church has never  sanctioned it.  The Sovereign 100                               Pontiffs have claimed and exercised  the right to deprive princes of their principality, and to  absolve their subjects from the oath of fidelity.  Whether the  Popes rightly claimed and exercised that power is not now the  question; but their having claimed and exercised it proves that  the Church does not admit the inamissibility of power and passive  obedience; for the action of the Pope was judicial, not  legislative.  The Pope has never claimed the right to depose a  prince till by his own act he has, under the moral law or the  constitution of his state, forfeited his power, nor to absolve  subjects from their allegiance till their oath, according to its  true intent and meaning, has ceased to bind.  If the Church has  always asserted with the Apostle there is no power but from  God--non est potestas nisi a Deo--she has always through her  doctors maintained that it is a trust to be exercised for the  public good, and is forfeited when persistently exercised in a  contrary sense.  St. Augustine, St. Thomas, and Suarez all  maintain that unjust laws are violences rather than laws, and do  not oblige, except in charity or prudence, and that the republic  may change its magistrates, and even its constitution, if it sees proper to do so.

That God, as universal Creator, is Sovereign 101                                              Lord and proprietor  of all created things or existences, visible or invisible, is  certain; for the maker has the absolute right to the thing made;  it is his, and he may do with it as he will.  As he is sole  creator, he alone hath dominion; and as he is absolute creator,  he has absolute dominion over all the things which he has made.   The guaranty against oppression is his own essential nature, is  in the plenitude of his own being, which is the plenitude of  wisdom and goodness.  He cannot contradict himself, be other than  he is, or act otherwise than according to his own essential  nature.  As he is, in his own eternal and immutable essence,  supreme reason and supreme good, his dominion must always in its  exercise be supremely good and supremely reasonable, therefore  supremely just and equitable.  From him certainly is all power;  he is unquestionably King of kings, and Lord of lords.  By him  kings reign and magistrates decree just things.  He may, at his  will, set up or pull down kings, rear or overwhelm empires,  foster the infant colony, and make desolate the populous city.   All this is unquestionably true, and a simple dictate of reason  common to all men.  But in what sense is it true?  Is it true in  a supernatural sense?  Or is it true only in the sense 102                                                        that it is  true that by him we breathe, perform any or all of our natural  functions, and in him live, and move, and have our being?

Viewed in their first cause, all things are the immediate  creation of God, and are supernatural, and from the point of view  of the first cause the Scriptures usually speak, for the great  purpose and paramount object of the sacred writers, as of  religion itself, is to make prominent the fact that God is  universal creator, and supreme governor, and therefore the first  and final cause of all things.  But God creates second causes, or  substantial existences, capable themselves of acting and  producing effects in a secondary sense, and hence he is said to  be causa causarum, cause of causes.  What is done by these second  causes or creatures is done eminently by him, for they exist only  by his creative act, and produce only by virtue of his active  presence, or effective concurrence.  What he does through them or  through their agency is done by him, not immediately, but  mediately, and is said to be done naturally, as what he does  immediately is said to be done supernaturally.  Natural is what  God does through second causes, which he creates; supernatural is  that which he does by himself alone, without their intervention  or agency.  Sovereignty, or 105                             the right to govern, is in him, and  he may at his will delegate it to men either mediately or  immediately, by a direct and express appointment, or mediately  through nature.  In the absence of all facts proving its  delegation direct and express, it must be assumed to be mediate,  through second causes.  The natural is always to be presumed, and  the supernatural is to be admitted only on conclusive proof.

The people of Israel had a supernatural vocation, and they  received their law, embracing their religious and civil  constitution and their ritual directly from God at the hand of  Moses, and various individuals from time to time appear to have  been specially called to be their judges, rulers, or kings.  Saul  was so called, and so was David. David and his line appear, also,  to have been called not only to supplant Saul and his line, but  to have been supernaturally invested with the kingdom forever;  but it does not appear that the royal power with which David and  his line were invested was inamissible.  They lost it in the  Babylonish captivity, and never afterwards recovered it.  The  Asmonean princes were of another line, and when our Lord came the  sceptre was in the hands of Herod, an Idumean Or Edomite.  The  promise made, to David and 104                            his house is generally held by  Christian commentators to have received its fulfilment in the  everlasting spiritual royalty of the Messiah, sprung through Mary  from David's line.

The Christian Church is supernaturally constituted and  supernaturally governed, but the persons selected to exercise  powers supernaturally defined, from the Sovereign Pontiff down to  the humblest parish priest are selected and inducted into office  through human agency.  The Gentiles very generally claimed to  have received their laws from the gods, but it does not appear,  save in exceptional cases, that they claimed that their princes  were designated and held their powers by the direct and express  appointment of the god.  Save in the case of the Jews, and that  of the Church, there is no evidence that any particular  government exists or ever has existed by direct or express  appointment, or otherwise than by the action of the Creator  through second causes, or what is called his ordinary providence.   Except David and his line, there is no evidence of the express  grant by the Divine Sovereign to any individual or family, class  or caste of the government of any nation or country.  Even those  Christian princes who professed to reign "by the grace of God,"  never claimed that they received their principalities  105                                                       from God  otherwise than through his ordinary providence, and meant by it  little more than an acknowledgment of their dependence on him,  their obligation to use their power according to his law and  their accountability to him for the use they make of it.

The doctrine is not favorable to human liberty, for it recognizes  no rights of man in face of civil society.  It consecrates  tyranny, and makes God the accomplice of the tyrant, if we  suppose all governments have actually existed by his express  appointment.  It puts the king in the place of God, and requires  us to worship in him the immediate representative of the Divine  Being.  Power is irresponsible and inamissible, and however it  may be abused, or however corrupt and oppressive may be its  exercise, there is no human redress.  Resistance to power is  resistance to God.  There is nothing for the people but passive  obedience and unreserved submission.  The doctrine, in fact,  denies all human government, and allows the people no voice in  the management of their own affairs, and gives no place for human  activity.  It stands opposed to all republicanism, and makes  power an hereditary and indefeasible right, not a trust which he  who holds it may forfeit, and of which he may be deprived if he  abuses it.





106 CHAPTER VI.

ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT--CONCLUDED.


VI. The theory which derives the right of government from the  direct and express appointment of God is sometimes modified so as  to mean that civil authority is derived from God through the  spiritual authority.  The patriarch combined in his person both  authorities, and was in his own household both priest and king,  and so originally was in his own tribe the chief, and in his  kingdom the king.  When the two offices became separated is not  known.  In the time of Abraham they were still united.   Melchisedech, king of Salem, was both priest and king, and the  earliest historical records of kings present them as offering  sacrifices.  Even the Roman emperor was Pontifex Maximus as well  as Imperator, but that was so not because the two offices were  held to be inseparable, but because they were both conferred on  the same person by the republic.  In Egypt, in the time of Moses,  the royal authority and 107                         the priestly were separated and held by  different persons.  Moses, in his legislation for his nation,  separated them, and instituted a sacerdotal order or caste.  The  heads of tribes and the heads of families are, under his law,  princes, but not priests, and the priesthood is conferred on and  restricted to his own tribe of Levi, and more especially the  family of his own brother Aaron.

The priestly office by its own nature is superior to the kingly,  and in all primitive nations with a separate, organized  priesthood, whether a true priesthood or a corrupt, the priest is  held to be above the king, elects or establishes the law by which  is selected the temporal chief, and inducts him into his office,  as if he received his authority from God through the priesthood.   The Christian priesthood is not a caste, and is transmitted by  the election of grace, not as with the Israelites and all  sacerdotal nations, by natural Generation.  Like Him whose  priests they are, Christian priests are priests after the order  of Melchisedech, who was without priestly descent, without father  or mother of the priestly line.  But in being priests after the  order of Melchisedech, they are both priests and kings, as  Melchisedech was, and as was our Lord himself, to whom was given  by his 108        Father all power in heaven and in earth.  The Pope, or  Supreme Pontiff, is the vicar of our Lord on earth, his  representative--the representative not only of him who is our  invisible High-Priest, but of him who is King of kings and Lord  of lords, therefore of both the priestly and the kingly power.   Consequently, no one can have any mission to govern in the state  any more than in the church, unless derived from God directly or  indirectly through the Pope or Supreme Pontiff.  Many theologians  and canonists in the Middle Ages so held, and a few perhaps hold  so still.  The bulls and briefs of several Popes, as Gregory VII.,  Innocent Ill., Gregory IX., Innocent IV., and Boniface VIII.,  have the appearance of favoring it.

At one period the greater part of the medieval kingdoms and  principalities were fiefs of the Holy See, and recognized the  Holy Father as their suzerain.  The Pope revived the imperial  diunity in the person of Charlemagne, and none could claim that  dignity in the Western world unless elected and crowned by him,  that is, unless elected directly by the Pope or by electors  designated by him, and acting under his authority.  There can be  no question that the spiritual is superior to the temporal, and  that the temporal is bound in the very nature of things 109                                                         to conform  to the spiritual, and any law enacted by the civil power in  contravention of the law of God is null and void from the  beginning.  This is what Mr. Seward meant by the higher law, a  law higher even than the Constitution of the United States.   Supposing this higher law, and supposing that kings and princes  hold from God through the spiritual society, it is very evident  that the chief of that society would have the right to deprive  them, and to absolve their subjects, as on several occasions he  actually has done.

But this theory has never been a dogma of the Church, nor, to any  great extent, except for a brief period, maintained by  theologians or canonists.  The Pope conferred the imperial  dignity on Charlemagne and his successors, but not the civil  power, at least out of the Pope's own temporal dominions.  The  emperor of Germany was at first elected by the Pope, and  afterwards by hereditary electors designated or accepted by him,  but the king of the Germans with the full royal authority could  be elected and enthroned without the papal intervention or  permission.  The suzerainty of the Holy See over Italy, Naples,  Aragon, Muscovy, England, and other European states, was by  virtue of feudal relations, not by virtue of the spiritual au- 110                                                              thority  of the Holy See or the vicarship of the Holy Father.  The right  to govern under feudalism was simply an estate, or property; and  as the church could acquire and hold property, nothing prevented  her holding fiefs, or her chief from being suzerain.  The  expressions in the papal briefs and bulls, taken in connection  with the special relations existing between the Pope and emperor  in the Middle Ages, and his relations with other states as their  feudal sovereign, explained by the controversies concerning  rights growing out of these relations, will be found to give no  countenance to the theory in question.

These relations really existed, and they gave the Pope certain  temporal rights in certain states, even the temporal supremacy,  as he has still in what is left him of the States of the Church;  but they were exceptional or accidental relations, not the  universal and essential relations between the church and the  state.  The rights that grew out of these relations were real  rights, sacred and inviolable, but only where and while the  relations subsisted.  They, for the most part, grew out of the  feudal system introduced into the Roman empire by its barbarian  conquerors, and necessarily ceased with the political order in  which they originated.  Undoubtedly the church consecrated 111                                                            civil  rulers, but this did not imply that they received their power or  right to govern from God through her; but implied that their  persons were sacred, and that violence to them would be  sacrilege; that they held the Christian faith, and acknowledged  themselves bound to protect it, and to govern their subjects  justly, according to the law of God.

The church, moreover, has always recognized the distinction of  the two powers, and although the Pope owes to the fact that he is  chief of the spiritual society, his temporal principality, no  theologian or canonist of the slightest respectability would  argue that he derives his rights as temporal sovereign from his  rights as pontiff.  His rights as pontiff depend on the express  appointment of God; his rights as temporal prince are derived  from the same source from which other princes derive their  rights, and are held by the same tenure.  Hence canonists have  maintained that the subjects of other states may even engage in  war with the Pope as prince, without breach of their fidelity to  him as pontiff or supreme visible head of the church.

The church not only distinguishes between the two powers, but  recognizes as legitimate, governments that manifestly do not  derive from God through her.  St. Paul enjoins obedience 112                                                          to the  Roman emperors for conscience' sake, and the church teaches that  infidels and heretics may have legitimate government; and if she  has ever denied the right of any infidel or heretical prince, it  has been on the ground that the constitution and laws of his  principality require him to profess and protect the Catholic  faith.  She tolerates resistance in a non-Catholic state no more  than in a Catholic state to the prince; and if she has not  condemned and cut off from her communion the Catholics who in our  struggle have joined the Secessionists and fought in their ranks  against the United States, it is because the prevalence of the  doctrine of State sovereignty has seemed to leave a reasonable  doubt whether they were really rebels fighting against their  legitimate sovereign or not.

No doubt, as the authority of the church is derived immediately  from God in a supernatural manner, and as she holds that the  state derives its authority only mediately from him, in a natural  mode, she asserts the superiority of her authority, and that, in  case of conflict between the two powers, the civil must yield.   But this is only saying that supernatural is above natural.   But--and this is the important point--she does not teach, nor  permit the faithful to 113                        hold, that the supernatural abrogates the  natural, or in any way supersedes it.  Grace, say the  theologians, supposes nature, gratia supponit naturam.  The  church in the matter of government accepts the natural, aids it,  elevates it, and is its firmest support.

VII. St. Augustine, St. Gregory Magnus, St. Thomas, Bellarmin,  Suarez, and the theologians generally, hold that princes derive  their power from God through the people, or that the people,  though not the source, are the medium of all political authority,  and therefore rulers are accountable for the use they make of  their power to both God and the people.

This doctrine agrees with the democratic theory in vesting  sovereignty in the people, instead of the king or the nobility, a  particular individual, family, class, or caste; and differs from  it, as democracy is commonly explained, in understanding by the  people, the people collectively, not individually--the organic  people, or people fixed to a given territory, not the people as a  mere population--the people in the republican sense of the word  nation, not in the barbaric or despotic sense; and in deriving  the sovereignty from God, from whom is all power, and except from  whom there is and can be no power, in- 114                                      stead of asserting it as the  underived and indefeasible right of the people in their "own  native right and might."  The people not being God, and being  only what philosophers call a second cause, they are and can be  sovereign only in a secondary and relative sense.  It asserts the  divine origin of power, while democracy asserts its human origin.   But as, under the law of nature, all men are equal, or have equal  rights as men, one man has and can have in himself no right to  govern another; and as man is never absolutely his own, but  always and everywhere belongs to his Creator, it is clear that no  government originating in humanity alone can be a legitimate  government.  Every such government is founded on the assumption  that man is God, which is a great mistake--is, in fact, the  fundamental sophism which underlies every error and every sin.

The divine origin of government, in the sense asserted by  Christian theologians, is never found distinctly set forth in the  political writings of the ancient Greek and Roman writers.   Gentile philosophy had lost the tradition of creation, as some  modern philosophers, in so-called Christian nations, are fast  losing it, and were as unable to explain the origin of government  as they were the origin of man himself.

115 Even Plato, the profoundest of all ancient philosophers, and the  most faithful to the traditionary wisdom of the race, lacks the  conception of creation, and never gets above that of generation  and formation.  Things are produced by the Divine Being  impressing his own ideas, eternal in his own mind, on a  pre-existing matter, as a seal on wax.  Aristotle teaches  substantially the same doctrine.  Things eternally exist as  matter and form, and all the Divine Intelligence does, is to  unite the form to the matter, and change it, as the schoolmen say,  from materia informis to materia formata.  Even the Christian  Platonists and Peripatetics never as philosophers assert creation;  they assert it, indeed, but as theologians, as a fact of  revelation, not as a fact of science; and hence it is that their  theology and their philosophy never thoroughly harmonize, or at  least are not shown to harmonize throughout.

Speaking generally, the ancient Gentile philosophers were  pantheists, and represented the universe either as God or as an  emanation from God.  They had no proper conception of Providence,  or the action of God in nature through natural agencies, or as  modern physicists say, natural laws.  If they recognized the  action of divinity at all, it was a supernatural 116                                                  or miraculous  intervention of some god.  They saw no divine intervention in any  thing naturally explicable, or explicable by natural laws.   Having no conception of the creative act, they could have none of  its immanence, or the active and efficacious presence of the  Creator in all his works, even in the action of second causes  themselves.  Hence they could not assert the divine origin of  government, or civil authority, without supposing it  supernaturally founded, and excluding all human and natural  agencies from its institution.  Their writings may be studied  with advantage on the constitution of the state, on the practical  workings of different forms of government, as well as on the  practical administration of affairs, but never on the origin of  the state, and the real ground of its authority.

The doctrine is derived from Christian theology, which teaches  that there is no power except from God, and enjoins civil  obedience as a religious duty.  Conscience is accountable to God  alone, and civil government, if it had only a natural or human  origin, could not bind it.  Yet Christianity makes the civil law,  within its legitimate sphere, as obligatory on conscience as the  divine law itself, and no man is blameless before God who is not  blameless before the state.  No man performs faithfully his  religious 117           duties who neglects his civil duties, and hence, the  law of the church allows no one to retire from the world and  enter a religious order, who has duties that bind him or her to  the family or the state; though it is possible that the law is  not always strictly observed, and that individuals sometimes  enter a convent for the sake of getting rid of those duties, or  the equally important duty of taking care of themselves.  But by  asserting the divine origin of government, Christianity  consecrates civil authority, clothes it with a religious  character, and makes civil disobedience, sedition, insurrection,  rebellion, revolution, civil turbulence of any sort or degree,  sins against God as well as crimes against the state.  For the  same reason she makes usurpation, tyranny, oppression of the  people by civil rulers, offences against God as well as against  society, and cognizable by the spiritual authority.

After the establishment of the Christian church, after its public  recognition, and when conflicting claims arose between the two  powers--the civil and the ecclesiastical--this doctrine of the  divine origin of civil government was abused, and turned against  the church with most disastrous consequences.  While the Roman  Empire of the West subsisted, and even after its 118                                                  fall, so long as  the emperor of the East asserted and practically maintained his  authority in the Exarchate of Ravenna and the Duchy of Rome, the  Popes comported themselves, in civil matters, as subjects of the  Roman emperor, and set forth no claim to temporal independence.   But when the emperor had lost Rome, and all his possessions in  Italy, had abandoned them, or been deprived of them by the  barbarians, and ceased to make any efforts to recover them, the  Pope was no longer a subject, even in civil matters, of the  emperor, and owed him no civil allegiance.  He became civilly  independent of the Roman Empire, and had only spiritual relations  with it.  To the new powers that sprang up in Europe he appears  never to have acknowledged any civil subjection, and uniformly  asserted, in face of them, his civil as well as spiritual  independence.

This civil independence the successors of Charlemagne, who  pretended to be the successors of the Roman Emperors of the West,  and called their empire the Holy Roman Empire, denied, and  maintained that the Pope owed them civil allegiance, or that, in  temporals, the emperor was the Pope's superior.  If, said the  emperor, or his lawyers for him, the civil power is from God, as  it must be, since non est potestas  119                                    nisi a Deo, the state stands  on the same footing with the church, and the imperial power  emanates from as high a source as the Pontifical. The  emperor is then as supreme in temporals as the Pope in  spirituals, and as the emperor is subject to the pope in  spirituals, so must the Pope be subject to the emperor in  temporals.  As at the time when the dispute arose, the temporal  interests of churchmen were so interwoven with their spiritual  rights, the pretensions of the emperor amounted practically to  the subjection in spirituals as well as temporals of the  ecclesiastical authority to the civil, and absorbed the church in  the state, the reasoning was denied, and churchmen replied: The  Pope represents the spiritual order, which is always and  everywhere supreme over the temporal, since the spiritual order  is the divine sovereignty itself.  Always and everywhere, then,  is the Pope independent of the emperor, his superior, and to  subject him in any thing to the emperor would be as repugnant to  reason as to subject the soul to the body, the spirit to the  flesh, heaven to earth, or God to man.

If the universal supremacy claimed for the Pope, rejoined the  imperialists, be conceded, the state would be absorbed in the  church, the autonomy of civil society would be destroyed, and 120 civil rulers would have no functions but to do the bidding of the  clergy.  It would establish a complete theocracy, or, rather,  clerocracy, of all possible governments the government the most  odious to mankind, and the most hostile to social progress.  Even  the Jews could not, or would not, endure it, and prayed God to  give them a king, that they might be like other nations.

In the heat of the controversy neither party clearly and  distinctly perceived the true state of the question, and each was  partly right and partly wrong.  The imperialists wanted room for  the free activity of civil society, the church wanted to  establish in that society the supremacy of the moral order, or  the law of God, without which governments can have no stability,  and society no real well-being.  The real solution of the  difficulty was always to be found in the doctrine of the church  herself, and had been given time and again by her most approved  theologians.  The Pope, as the visible head of the spiritual  society, is, no doubt, superior to the emperor, not precisely  because he represents a superior order, but because the church,  of which he is the visible chief, is a supernatural institution,  and holds immediately from God; whereas civil society, 121 represented by the emperor, holds from God only mediately,  through second causes, or the people.  Yet, though derived from  God only through the people, civil authority still holds from God,  and derives its right from Him through another channel than the  church or spiritual society, and, therefore, has a right, a  sacredness, which the church herself gives not, and must  recognize and respect.  This she herself teaches in teaching that  even infidels, as we have seen, may have legitimate government,  and since, though she interprets and applies the law of God, both  natural and revealed, she makes neither.

Nevertheless, the imperialists or the statists insisted on their  false charge against the Pope, that he labored to found a purely  theocratic or clerocratic government, and finding themselves  unable to place the representative of the civil society on the  same level with the representative of the spiritual, or to  emancipate the state from the law of God while they conceded the  divine origin or right of government, they sought to effect its  independence by asserting for it only a natural or purely human  origin.  For nearly two centuries the most popular and  influential writers on government have rejected the divine origin  and ground of civil authority, 122                                and excluded God from the state.   They have refused to look beyond second causes, and have labored  to derive authority from man alone.  They have not only separated  the state from the church as an external corporation, but from  God as its internal lawgiver, and by so doing have deprived the  state of her sacredness, inviolability, or hold on the conscience,  scoffed at loyalty as a superstition, and consecrated not civil  authority, but what is called "the right of insurrection."  Under  their teaching the age sympathizes not with authority in its  efforts to sustain itself and protect society, but with those who  conspire against it--the insurgents, rebels, revolutionists  seeking its destruction.  The established government that seeks  to enforce respect for its legitimate authority and compel  obedience to the laws, is held to be despotic, tyrannical,  oppressive, and resistance to it to be obedience to God, and a  wild howl rings through Christendom against the prince that will  not stand still and permit the conspirators to cut his throat.   There is hardly a government now in the civilized world that can  sustain itself for a moment without an armed force sufficient to  overawe or crush the party or parties in permanent conspiracy  against it.

This result is not what was aimed at or de- 123                                           sired, but it is the  logical or necessary result of the attempt to erect the state on  atheistical principles.  Unless founded on the divine sovereignty,  authority can sustain itself only by force, for political atheism  recognizes no right but might.  No doubt the politicians have  sought an atheistical, or what is the same thing, a purely human,  basis for government, in order to secure an open field for human  freedom and activity, or individual or social progress.  The end  aimed at has been good, laudable even, but they forgot that  freedom is possible only with authority that protects it against  license as well as against despotism, and that there can be no  progress where there is nothing that is not progressive.  In  civil society two things are necessary--stability and movement.   The human is the element of movement, for in it are possibilities  that can be only successively actualized.  But the element of  stability can be found only in the divine, in God, in whom there  is no unactualized possibility, who, therefore, is immovable,  immutable, and eternal.  The doctrine that derives authority from  God through the people, recognizes in the state both of these  elements, and provides alike for stability and progress.

This doctrine is not mere theory; it simply 124                                             states the real order  of things.  It is not telling what ought to be, but what is in  the real order.  It only asserts for civil government the  relation to God which nature herself holds to him, which the  entire universe holds to the Creator.  Nothing in man, in nature,  in the universe, is explicable without the creative act of God,  for nothing exists without that act.  That God "in the beginning  created heaven and earth," is the first principle of all science  as of all existences, in politics no less than in theology.  God  and creation comprise all that is or exists, and creation, though  distinguishable from God as the act from the actor, is  inseparable from him, "for in Him we live and move and have our  being."  All creatures are joined to him by his creative act, and  exist only as through that act they participate of his being.   Through that act he is immanent as first cause in all creatures  and in every act of every creature.  The creature deriving from  his creative act can no more continue to exist than it could  begin to exist without it.  It is as bad philosophy as theology,  to suppose that God created the universe, endowed it with certain  laws of development or activity, wound it up, gave it a jog, set  it agoing, and then left it to go of itself.  It cannot go of  itself, because it does not exist 125                                   of itself.  It did not merely  not begin to exist, but it cannot continue to exist, without the  creative act.  Old Epicurus was a sorry philosopher, or rather,  no philosopher at all.  Providence is as necessary as creation,  or rather, Providence is only continuous creation, the creative  act not suspended or discontinued, or not passing over from the  creature and returning to God.

Through the creative act man participates of God, and he can  continue to exist, act, or live only by participating through it  of his divine being.  There is, therefore , something of divinity,  so to speak, in every creature, and therefore it is that God is  worshipped in his works without idolatry.  But he creates  substantial existences capable of acting as second causes.  Hence,  in all living things there is in their life a divine element and  a natural element; in what is called human life, there are the  divine and the human, the divine as first and the human as second  cause, precisely what the doctrine of the great Christian  theologians assert to be the fact with all legitimate or real  government.  Government cannot exist without the efficacious  presence of God any more than man himself, and men might as well  attempt to build up a world as to attempt to found a state  without 126         God.  A government founded on atheistical principles were  less than a castle in the air.  It would have nothing to rest on,  would not be even so much as "the baseless fabric of a vision,"  and they who imagine that they really do exclude God from their  politics deceive themselves; for they accept and use principles  which, though they know it not, are God.  What they call abstract  principles, or abstract forms of reason, without which there were  no logic, are not abstract, but the real, living God himself.   Hence government, like man himself, participates of the divine  being, and, derived from God through the people, it at the same  time participates of human reason and will, thus reconciling  authority with freedom, and stability with progress.

The people, holding their authority from God, hold it not as an  inherent right, but as a trust from Him, and are accountable to  Him for it.  It is not their own.  If it were their own they  might do with it as they pleased, and no one would have any right  to call them to an account; but holding it as a trust from God,  they are under his law, and bound to exercise it as that law  prescribes.  Civil rulers, holding their authority from God  through the people, are accountable for it both to Him and to  them.  If 127           they abuse it they are justiciable by the people and  punishable by God himself.

Here is the guaranty against tyranny, oppression, or bad  government, or what in modern times is called the responsibility  of power.  At the same time the state is guarantied against  sedition, insurrection, rebellion, revolution, by the elevation  of the civic virtues to the rank of religious, virtues, and  making loyalty a matter of conscience.  Religion is brought to  the aid of the state, not indeed as a foreign auxiliary, but as  integral in the political order itself.  Religion sustains the  state, not because it externally commands us to obey the higher  powers, or to be submissive to the powers that be, not because it  trains the people to habits of obedience, and teaches them to be  resigned and patient under the grossest abuses of power, but  because it and the state are in the same order, and inseparable,  though distinct, parts of one and the same whole.  The church and  the state, as corporations or external governing bodies, are  indeed separate in their spheres, and the church does not absorb  the state, nor does the state the church; but both are from God,  and both work to the same end, and when each is rightly  understood there is no antithesis or antagonism between them.   Men serve God in serving the state as 128                                       directly as in serving the  church.  He who dies on the battle-field fighting for his country  ranks with him who dies at the stake for his faith.  Civic  virtues are themselves religious virtues, or at least virtues  without which there are no religious virtues, since no man who  loves not his brother does or can love God.

The guaranties offered the state or authority are ample, because  it has not only conscience, moral sentiment, interest, habit, and  the via inertia of the mass, but the whole physical force of the  nation, at its command.  The individual has, indeed, only moral  guaranties against the abuse of power by the sovereign people,  which may no doubt sometimes prove insufficient.  But moral  guaranties are always better than none, and there are none where  the people are held to be sovereign in their own native right and  might, organized or unorganized, inside or outside of the  constitution, as most modern democratic theorists maintain;  since, if so, the will of the people, however expressed, is the  criterion of right and wrong, just and unjust, true and false, is  infallible and impeccable, and no moral right can ever be pleaded  against it; they are accountable to nobody, and, let them do what  they please, they can do no wrong.  This would place the  individual at the mercy 129                         of the state, and deprive him of all  right to complain, however oppressed or cruelly treated.  This  would establish the absolute despotism of the state, and deny  every thing like the natural rights of man, or individual and  personal freedom, as has already been shown.  Now as men do take  part in government, and as men, either individually or  collectively, are neither infallible nor impeccable, it is never  to be expected, under any possible constitution or form of  government, that authority will always be wisely and justly  exercised, that wrong will ever be done, and the rights of  individuals never in any instance be infringed; but with the  clear understanding that all power is of God, that the political  sovereignty is vested in the people or the collective body, that  the civil rulers hold from God through them and are responsible  to Him through them, and justiciable by them, there is all the  guaranty against the abuse of power by the, nation, the political  or organic people, that the nature of the case admits.  The  nation may, indeed, err or do wrong, but in the way supposed you  get in the government all the available wisdom and virtue the  nation has, and more is never, under any form or constitution of  government, practicable or to be expected,

130 It is a maxim with constitutional statesmen, that "the king  reigns, not governs."  The people, though sovereign under God,  are not the government.  The government is in their name and by  virtue of authority delegated from God through them, but they are  not it, are not their own ministers.  It is only when the people  forget this and undertake to be their own ministers and to manage  their own affairs immediately by themselves instead of selecting  agents to do it for them, and holding their agents to a strict  account for their management, that they are likely to abuse their  power or to sanction injustice.  The nation may be misled or  deceived for a moment by demagogues, those popular courtiers, but  as a rule it is disposed to be just and to respect all natural  rights.  The wrong is done by individuals who assume to speak in  their name, to wield their power, and to be themselves the state.   L'etat, c'est moi. I am the state, said Louis XIV. of France, and while that was conceded the French nation could have in its  government no more wisdom or virtue than he possessed, or at  least no more than he could appreciate.  And under his government  France was made responsible for many deeds that the nation would  never have sanctioned, if it bad been recognized as the  deposi- 131       tary of the national sovereignty, or as the French state,  and answerable to God for the use it made of political power, or  the conduct of its government.

But be this as it may, there evidently can be no physical force  in the nation to coerce the nation itself in case it goes wrong,  for if the sovereignty vests in the nation, only the nation can  rightly command or authorize the employment of force, and all  commissions must run in its name.  Written constitutions alone  will avail little, for they emanate from the people, who can  disregard them, if they choose, and alter or revoke them at will.   The reliance for the wisdom and justice of the state must after  all be on moral guaranties.  In the very nature of the case there  are and can be no other.  But these, placed in a clear light,  with an intelligent and religious people, will seldom be found  insufficient.  Hence the necessity for the protection, not of  authority simply or chiefly, but of individual rights and the  liberty of religion and intelligence in the nation, of the  general understanding that the nation holds its power to govern  as a trust from God, and that to God through the people all civil  rulers are strictly responsible.  Let the mass of the people in  any nation lapse into the ignorance and barba- 132                                              rism of atheism, or  lose themselves in that supreme sophism called pantheism, the  grand error of ancient as well as of modern gentilism, and  liberty, social or political, except that wild kind of liberty,  and perhaps not even that should be excepted, which obtains among  savages, would be lost and irrecoverable.

But after all, this theory does not meet all the difficulties of  the case.  It derives sovereignty from God, and thus asserts the  divine origin of government in the sense that the origin of  nature is divine; it derives it from God through the people,  collectively, or as society, and therefore concedes it a natural,  human, and social element, which distinguishes it from pure  theocracy.  It, however, does not explain how authority comes  from God to the people.  The ruler, king, prince, or emperor,  holds from God through the people, but how do the people  themselves hold from God?  Mediately or immediately?  If  mediately, what is the medium?  Surely not the people themselves.   The people can no more be the medium than the principle of their  own sovereignty. If immediately, then God governs in them as he  does in the church, and no man is free to think or act contrary  to popular opinion, or in any case to question the wisdom or  justice 133         of any of the acts of the state, which is arriving at  state absolutism by another process.  Besides, this would  theoretically exclude all human or natural activity, all human  intelligence and free-will from the state, which were to fall  into either pantheism or atheism.

VIII. The right of government to govern, or political authority,  is derived by the collective people or society, from God through  the law of nature.  Rulers hold from God through the people or  nation, and the people or nation hold from God through the  natural law.  How nations are founded or constituted, or a  particular people becomes a sovereign political people, invested  with the rights of society, will be considered in following  chapters.  Here it suffices to say that supposing a political  people or nation, the sovereignty vests in the community, not  supernaturally, or by an external supernatural appointment, as  the clergy hold their authority, but by the natural law, or law  by which God governs the whole moral creation.

They who assert the origin of government in nature are right, so  far as they derive it from God through the law of nature, and  are wrong only when they understand by the law of nature the  physical force or forces of nature, which 134                                           are not laws in the  primary and proper sense of the term.  The law of nature is not  the order or rule of the divine action in nature which is  rightfully called providence, but is, as has been said, law in  its proper and primary sense, ordained by the Author of nature,  as its sovereign and supreme Lawgiver, and binds all of his  creatures who are endowed with reason and free-will, and is  called natural, because promulgated through the reason common to  all men.  Undoubtedly, it was in the first instance, to the first  man, supernaturally promulgated, as it is republished and  confirmed by Christianity, as an integral part of the Christian  code itself.  Man needs even yet instruction in relation to  matters lying within the range of natural reason, or else secular  schools, colleges, and universities would be superfluous, and  manifestly the instructor of the first man could have been only  the Creator himself.

The knowledge of the natural law has been transmitted from Adam  to us through two channels--reason, which is in every man, and in  immediate relation with the Creator, and the traditions of the  primitive instruction embodied in language and what the Romans  call jus gentium, or law common to all civilized nations.  Under  this law. whose prescriptions are promul- 135                                         gated through reason and  embodied in universal jurisprudence, nations are providentially  constituted, and invested with political sovereignty; and as they  are constituted under this law and hold from God through it, it  defines their respective rights and powers, their limitation and  their extent.

The political sovereignty, under the law of nature, attaches to  the people, not individually, but collectively, as civil or  political society.  It is vested in the political community or  nation, not in an individual, or family, or a class, because,  under the natural law, all men are equal, as they are under the  Christian law, and one man has, in his own right, no authority  over another.  The family has in the father a natural chief, but  political society has no natural chief or chiefs.  The authority  of the father is domestic, not political, and ceases when his  children have attained to majority, have married and become heads  of families themselves, or have ceased to make part of the  paternal household.  The recognition of the authority of the  father beyond the limits of his own household, is, if it ever  occurs, by virtue of the ordinance, the consent, express or  tacit, of the political society.  There are no natural-born  political chiefs, and wherever we find men claiming 136                                                     or  acknowledged to be such, they are either usurpers, what the  Greeks called tyrants, or they are made such by the will or  constitution of the people or the nation.

Both monarchy and aristocracy were, no doubt, historically  developed from the authority of the patriarchs, and have  unquestionably been sustained by an equally false development of  the right of property, especially landed property.  The owner of  the land, or he who claimed to own it, claimed as an incident of  his ownership the right to govern it, and consequently to govern  all who occupied it.  But however valid may be the landlord's  title to the soil, and it is doubtful if man can own any thing in  land beyond the usufruct, it can give him under the law of nature  no political right.  Property, like all natural rights, is  entitled by the natural law to protection, but not to govern.   Whether it shall be made a basis of political power or not is a  question of political prudence, to be determined by the supreme  political authority.  It was the basis, and almost exclusive  basis, in the Middle Ages, under feudalism, and is so still in  most states.  France and the United States are the principal  exceptions in Christendom.  Property alone, or coupled with  birth, is made elsewhere in some form a basis of political 137 power, and where made so by the sovereign authority, it is  legitimate, but not wise nor desirable; for it takes from the  weak and gives to the strong.  The rich have in their riches  advantages enough over the poor, without receiving from the state  any additional advantage.  An aristocracy, in the sense of  families distinguished by birth, noble and patriotic services,  wealth, cultivation, refinement, taste, and manners, is desirable  in every nation, is a nation's ornament, and also its chief  support, but they need and should receive no political  recognition.  They should form no privileged class in the state  or political society.





CHAPTER VII

CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT.


The Constitution is twofold: the constitution of the state or  nation, and the constitution of the government.  The constitution  of the government is, or is held to be, the work of the nation  itself; the constitution of the state, or the people of the  state, is, in its origin at least, providential, given by God  himself, operating through historical events or natural causes.   The one originates in law, the other in historical fact.  The  nation must exist, and exist as a political community, before it  can give itself a constitution; and no state, any more than an  individual, can exist without a constitution of some sort.

The distinction between the providential constitution of the  people and the constitution of the government, is not always  made.  The illustrious Count de Maistre, one of the ablest  political philosophers who wrote in the last century, or the  first quarter of the present, in his work  139                                           on the Generative  Principle of Political Constitutions, maintains that constitutions are generated, not made, and excludes all human  agency from their formation and growth.  Disgusted with French  Jacobinism, from which he and his kin and country had suffered so  much, and deeply wedded to monarchy in both church and state, he  had the temerity to maintain that God creates expressly royal  families for the government of nations, and that it is idle for a  nation to expect a good government without a king who has  descended from one of those divinely created royal families.  It  was with some such thought, most likely, that a French  journalist, writing home from the United States, congratulated  the American people on having a Bonaparte in their army, so that  when their democracy failed, as in a few years it was sure to do,  they would have a descendant of a royal house to be their king or  emperor.  Alas! the Bonaparte has left us, and besides, he was  not the descendant of a royal house, and was, like the present  Emperor of the French, a decided parvenu.  Still, the Emperor of  the French, if only a parvenu, bears himself right imperially  among sovereigns, and has no peer among any of the descendants of  the old royal families of Europe 

140 There is a truth, however, in De Maistre's doctrine that  constitutions are generated, or developed, not created de novo,  or made all at once.  But nothing is more true than that a nation  can alter its constitution by its own deliberate and voluntary  action, and many nations have done so, and sometimes for the  better, as well as for the worse.  If the constitution once given is  fixed and unalterable, it must be wholly divine, and contain no  human element, and the people have and can have no hand in their  own government--the fundamental objection to the theocratic  constitution of society.  To assume it is to transfer to civil  society, founded by the ordinary providence of God, the  constitution of the church, founded by his gracious or  supernatural providence, and to maintain that the divine  sovereignty governs in civil society immediately and  supernaturally, as in the spiritual society.  But such is not the  fact.  God governs the nation by the nation itself, through its  own reason and free-will.  De Maistre is right only as to the  constitution the nation starts with, and as to the control which  that constitution necessarily exerts over the constitutional  changes the nation can successfully introduce.

The disciples of Jean Jacques Rousseau rec- 141                                           ognize no providential  constitution, and call the written instrument drawn up by a  convention of sovereign individuals the constitution, and the  only constitution, both of the people and the government.  Prior  to its adoption there is no government, no state, no political  community or authority.  Antecedently to it the people are an  inorganic mass, simply individuals, without any political or  national solidarity.  These individuals, they suppose, come  together in their own native right and might, organize themselves  into a political community, give themselves a constitution, and  draw up and vote rules for their government, as a number of  individuals might meet in a public hall and resolve themselves  into a temperance society or a debating club.  This might do very  well if the state were, like the temperance society or debating  club, a simple voluntary association, which men are free to join  or not as they please, and which they are bound to obey no  farther and no longer than suits their convenience.  But the  state is a power, a sovereignty; speaks to all within its  jurisdiction with an imperative voice; commands, and may use  physical force to compel obedience, when not voluntarily yielded.   Men are born its subjects, and no one can withdraw from it 142 without its express or tacit permission, unless for causes that  would justify resistance to its authority.  The right of subjects  to denationalize or expatriate themselves, except to escape a  tyranny or an oppression which would forfeit the rights of power  and warrant forcible resistance to it, does not exist, any more  than the right of foreigners to become citizens, unless by the  consent and authorization of the sovereign; for the citizen or  subject belongs to the state, and is bound to it.

The solidarity of the individuals composing the population of a  territory or country under one political head is a truth; but  "the solidarity of peoples," irrespective of the government or  political authority of their respective countries, so eloquently  preached a few years since by the Hungarian Kossuth, is not only  a falsehood, but a falsehood destructive of all government and of  all political organization.  Kossuth's doctrine supposes the  people, or the populations of all countries, are, irrespective of  their governments, bound together in solido, each for all and all  for each, and therefore not only free, but bound, wherever they  find a population struggling nominally for liberty against its  government, to rush with arms in their hands to its assistance--a  doctrine clearly incompati- 143                           ble with any recognition of political  authority or territorial rights.  Peoples or nations commune with  each other only through the national authorities, and when the  state proclaims neutrality or non-intervention, all its subjects  are bound to be neutral, and to abstain from all intervention on  either side.  There may be, and indeed there is, a solidarity,  more or less distinctly recognized, of Christian nations, but of  the populations with and through their governments, not without  them.  Still more strict is the solidarity of all the individuals  of one and the same nation.  These are all bound together, all  for each and each for all.  The individual is born into society  and under the government, and without the authority of the  government, which represents all and each, he cannot release  himself from his obligations.  The state is then by no means a  voluntary association.  Every one born or adopted into it is  bound to it, and cannot without its permission withdraw from it,  unless, as just said, it is manifest that he can have under it no  protection for his natural rights as a man, more especially for  his rights of conscience.  This is Vattel's doctrine, and the  dictate of common sense.

The constitution drawn up, ordained, and established by a nation  for itself is a law--the  144                          organic or fundamental law, if you will,  but a law, and is and must be the act of the sovereign power.   That sovereign power must exist before it can act, and it cannot  exist, if vested in the people or nation, without a constitution,  or without some sort of political organization of the people or  nation.  There must, then, be for every state or nation a  constitution anterior to the constitution which the nation gives  itself, and from which the one it gives itself derives all its  vitality and legal force.

Logic and historical facts are here, as elsewhere, coincident,  for creation and providence are simply the expression of the  Supreme Logic, the Logos, by whom all things are made.  Nations  have originated in various ways, but history records no instance  of a nation existing as an inorganic mass organizing itself into  a political community.  Every nation, at its first appearance  above the horizon, is found to have an organization of some sort.   This is evident from the only ways in which history shows us  nations originating.  These ways are: 1. The union of families in  the tribe. 2. The union of tribes in the nation. 3. The migration  of families, tribes, or nations in search of new settlements.  4. Colonization, military, agricultural, commercial, industrial,  religious, or penal. 5. War  145                             and conquest. 6. The revolt,  separation, and independence of provinces. 7. The intermingling  of the conquerors and conquered, and by amalgamation forming a  new people.  These are all the ways known to history, and in none  of these ways does a people, absolutely destitute of all  organization, constitute itself a state, and institute and carry  on civil government.

The family, the tribe, the colony are, if incomplete, yet  incipient states, or inchoate nations, with an organization,  individuality, and a centre of social life of their own.  The  families and tribes that migrate in search of new settlements  carry with them their family and tribal organizations, and  retain it for a long time.  The Celtic tribes retained it in Gaul  till broken up by the Roman conquest, under Caesar Augustus; in  Ireland, till the middle of the seventeenth century; and in  Scotland, till the middle of the eighteenth.  It subsists still  in the hordes of Tartary, the Arabs of the Desert, and the  Berbers or Kabyles of Africa.

Colonies, of whatever description, have been founded, if not by,  at least under, the authority of the mother country, whose  political constitution, laws, manners, and customs they carry  with them.  They receive from the parent state  146                                                a political  organization, which, though subordinate, yet constitutes them  embryonic states, with a unity, individuality, and centre of  public life in themselves, and which, when they are detached and  recognized as independent, render them complete states.  War and  conquest effect great national changes, but do not, strictly  speaking, create new states.  They simply extend and consolidate  the power of the conquering state.

Provinces revolt and become independent states or nations, but  only when they have previously existed as such, and have retained  the tradition of their old constitution and independence; or when  the administration has erected them into real though dependent  political communities.  A portion of the people of a state not so  erected or organized, that has in no sense had a distinct  political existence of its own, has never separated from the  national body and formed a new and independent nation.  It cannot  revolt; it may rise up against the government, and either  revolutionize and take possession of the state, or be put down by  the government as an insurrection.  The amalgamation of the  conquering and the conquered forms a new people, and modifies the  institutions of both, but does not necessarily form a  147                                                       new nation  or political community.  The English of to-day are very different  from both the Normans and the Saxons, or Dano-Saxons, of the time  of Richard Coeur de Lion, but they constitute the same state or  political community.  England is still England.

The Roman empire, conquered by the Northern barbarians, has been  cut up into several separate and independent nations, but because  its several provinces had, prior to their conquest by the Roman  arms, been independent nations or tribes, and more especially  because the conquerors themselves were divided into several  distinct nations or confederacies.  If the barbarians had been  united in a single nation or state, the Roman empire most likely  would have changed masters, indeed, but have retained its unity  and its constitution, for the Germanic nations that finally  seated themselves on its ruins had no wish to destroy its name or  nationality, for they were themselves more than half Romanized  before conquering Rome.  But the new nations into which the  empire has been divided have never been, at any moment, without  political or governmental organization, continued from the  constitution of the conquering tribe or nation, modified more or  less by what was retained from the empire.

148 It is not pretended that the constitutions of states cannot be  altered, or that every people starts with a constitution fully  developed, as would seem to be the doctrine of De Maistre.  The  constitution of the family is rather economical than political,  and the tribe is far from being a fully developed state.   Strictly speaking, the state, the modern equivalent for the city  of the Greeks and Romans, was not fully formed till men began to  build and live in cities, and became fixed to a national  territory.  But in the first place, the eldest born of the human  race, we are told, built a city, and even in cities we find  traces of the family and tribal organization long after their  municipal existence--in Athens down to the Macedonian conquest,  and in Rome down to the establishment of the Empire; and, in the  second place, the pastoral nations, though they have not  precisely the city or state organization, yet have a national  organization, and obey a national authority.  Strictly speaking,  no pastoral nation has a civil or political constitution, but  they have what in our modern tongues can be expressed by no other  term.  The feudal regime, which was in full vigor even in Europe  from the tenth to the close of the fourteenth century, had  nothing to do with cities, and really recognized no state 149                                                           proper;  yet who hesitates to speak of it as a civil or political system,  though a very imperfect one?

The civil order, as it now exists, was not fully developed in the  early ages.  For a long time the national organizations bore  unmistakable traces of having been developed from the patriarchal,  and modelled from the family or tribe, as they do still in all  the non-Christian world.  Religion itself, before the Incarnation,  bore traces of the same organization.  Even with the Jews,  religion was transmitted and disused, not as under Christianity  by conversion, but by natural generation or family adoption.   With all the Gentile tribes or nations, it was the same.  At  first the father was both priest and king, an when the two  offices were separated, the priests formed a distinct and  hereditary class or caste, rejected by Christianity, which, as we  have seen, admits priests only after the order of Melchisedech.   The Jews had the synagogue, and preserved the primitive  revelation in its purity and integrity; but the Greeks and  Romans, more fully than any other ancient nations, preserved or  developed the political order that best conforms to the Christian  religion; and Christianity, it is worthy of remark, followed in  the track of the Roman armies, and it gains  150                                             a permanent  establishment only where was planted, or where it is able to  plant, the Graeco-Roman civilization.  The Graeco-Roman republics  were hardly less a schoolmaster to bring the world to Christ in  the civil order, than the Jewish nation was to bring it to Him in  the spiritual order, or in faith and worship.  In the Christian  order nothing is by hereditary descent, but every thing is by  election of grace.  The Christian dispensation is teleological,  palingenesiac, and the whole order, prior to the Incarnation, was  initial, genesiac, and continued by natural generation, as it is  still in all nations and tribes outside of Christendom.  No  non-Christian people is a civilized people, and, indeed, the  human race seems not anywhere, prior to the Incarnation, to have  attained to its majority: and it is, perhaps, because the race  were not prepared for it, that the Word was not sooner incarnated.   He came only in the fulness of time, when the world was ready to  receive him.

The providential constitution is, in fact, that with which the  nation is born, and is, as long as the nation exists, the real  living and efficient constitution of the state.  It is the source  of the vitality of the state, that which controls or governs its  action, and determines its destiny.   151                                      The constitution which a  nation is said to give itself, is never the constitution of the  state, but is the law ordained by the state for the government  instituted under it.  Thomas Paine would admit nothing to be the  constitution but a written document which he could fold up and  put in his pocket, or file away in a pigeon-hole.  The Abbe  Sieyes pronounced politics a science which he had finished, and  he was ready to turn you out constitutions to order, with no  other defect than that they had, as Carlyle wittily says, no feet,  and could not go.  Many in the last century, and some, perhaps,  in the present, for folly as well as wisdom has her heirs,  confounded the written instrument with the constitution itself.   No constitution can be written on paper or engrossed on parchment.   What the convention may agree upon, draw up, and the people  ratify by their votes, is no constitution, for it is extrinsic to  the nation, not inherent and living in it--is, at best,  legislative instead of constitutive.  The famous Magna Charta  drawn up by Cardinal Langton, and wrung from John Lackland by the  English barons at Runnymede, was no constitution of England till  long after the date of its concession, and even then was no  constitution of the state, but a set of restrictions on power.   The constitution is 152                     the intrinsic or inherent and actual  constitution of the people or political community itself; that  which makes the nation what it is, and distinguishes it from  every other nation, and varies as nations themselves vary from  one another.

The constitution of the state is not a theory, nor is it drawn up  and established in accordance with any preconceived theory.  What  is theoretic in a constitution is unreal.  The constitutions  conceived by philosophers in their closets are constitutions only  of Utopia or Dreamland.  This world is not governed by  abstractions, for abstractions are nullities.  Only the concrete  is real, and only the real or actual has vitality or force.  The  French people adopted constitution after constitution of the most  approved pattern, and amid bonfires, beating of drums, sound of  trumpets, roar of musketry, and thunder of artillery, swore, no  doubt, sincerely as well as enthusiastically, to observe them,  but all to no effect; for they had no authority for the nation,  no hold on its affections, and formed no element of its life.   The English are great constitution-mongers--for other nations.   They fancy that a constitution fashioned after their own will fit  any nation that can be persuaded, wheedled, or bullied into  153 trying it on; but, unhappily, all that have tried it on have  found it only an embarrassment or encumbrance.  The doctor might  as well attempt to give an individual a new constitution, or the  constitution of another man, as the statesman to give a nation  any other constitution than that which it has, and with which it  is born.

The whole history of Europe, since the fall of the Roman empire,  proves this thesis.  The barbarian conquest of Rome introduced  into the nations founded on the site of the empire, a double  constitution--the barbaric and the civil--the Germanic and the  Roman in the West, and the Tartaric or Turkish and the  Graeco-Roman in the East.  The key to all modern history is in  the mutual struggles of these two constitutions and the interests  respectively associated with them, which created two societies on  the same territory, and, for the most part, under the same  national denomination.  The barbaric was the constitution of the  conquerors; they had the power, the government, rank, wealth, and  fashion, were reinforced down to the tenth century by fresh  hordes of barbarians, and had even brought the external  ecclesiastical society to a very great extent into harmony with  itself.  The Pope became a  154                            feudal sovereign, and the bishops and  mitred abbots feudal princes and barons.  Yet, after eight  hundred years of fierce struggle, the Roman constitution got the  upper hand, and the barbaric constitution, as far as it could not  be assimilated to the Roman, was eliminated.  The original Empire  of the West is now as thoroughly Roman in its constitution, its  laws, and its civilization, as it ever was under any of its  Christian emperors before the barbarian conquest.

The same process is going on in the East, though it has not  advanced so far, having begun there several centuries later, and  the Graeco-Roman constitution was far feebler there than in the  West at the epoch of the conquest.  The Germanic tribes that  conquered the West had long had close relations with the empire,  had served as its allies, and even in its armies, and were  partially Romanized.  Most of their chiefs had received a Roman  culture; and their early conversion to the Christian faith  facilitated the revival and permanence of the old Roman  constitution.  In the East it was different.  The conquerors had  no touch of Roman civilization, and, followers of the Prophet,  they were animated with an intense hatred, which, after the  conquest, was changed into a superb contempt, 155                                               of Christians and  Romans.  They had their civil constitution in the Koran; and the  Koran, in its principles, doctrines, and spirit, is exclusive and  profoundly intolerant.  The Graeco-Roman constitution was always  much weaker in the East, and had far greater obstacles to  overcome there than in the West; yet it has survived the shock of  the conquest.  Throughout the limits of the ancient Empire of the  East, the barbaric constitution has received and is daily  receiving rude blows, and, but as reenforced by barbarians lying  outside of the boundaries of that empire, would be no longer able  to sustain itself.  The Greek or Christian populations of the  empire are no longer in danger of being exterminated or absorbed  by the Mohammedan state or population.  They are the only living  and progressive people of the Ottoman Empire, and their complete  success in absorbing or expelling the Turk is only a question of  time.  They will, in all present probability, reestablish a  Christian and Roman East in much less time from the fall of  Constantinople in 1453, than it took the West from the fall of  Rome in 476 to put an end to the feudal or barbaric constitution  founded by its Germanic invaders.

Indeed, the Roman constitution, laws, and 156                                           civilization not only  gain the mastery in the nations seated within the limits of the  old Roman Empire, but extend their power through out the whole  civilized world.  The Graeco-Roman civilization is, in fact, the  only civilization now recognized, and nations are accounted  civilized only in proportion as they are Romanized and  Christianized.  The Roman law, as found in the Institutes,  Pandects, and Novellae of Justinian, or the Corpus Legis Civilis,  is the basis of the law and jurisprudence of all Christendom.   The Graeco-Roman civilization, called not improperly Christian  civilization, is the only progressive civilization.  The old  feudal system remains in England little more than an empty name.   The king is only the first magistrate of the kingdom, and the  House of Lords is only an hereditary senate.  Austria is hard at  work in the Roman direction, and finds her chief obstacle to  success in Hungary, with the Magyars whose feudalism retains  almost the full vigor of the Middle Ages.  Russia is moving in  the same direction; and Prussia and the smaller Germanic states  obey the same impulse.  Indeed, Rome has survived the  conquest--has conquered her conquerors, and now invades every  region from which they came.  The Roman Empire may be said to be  acknowledged 157              and obeyed in lands lying far beyond the farthest  limits reached by the Roman eagles, and to be more truly the  mistress of the world than under Augustus, Trajan, or the  Antonines.  Nothing can stand before the Christian and Romanized  nations, and all pagandom and Mohammedom combined are too weak to  resist their onward march.

All modern European revolutions result only in reviving the Roman  Empire, whatever the motives, interests, passions, or theories  that initiate them.  The French Revolution of the last century  and that of the present prove it.  France, let people say what  they will, stands at the head of the European civilized world,  and displays en grand all its good and all its bad tendencies.   When she moves, Europe moves; when she has a vertigo, all  European nations are dizzy; when she recovers her health, her  equilibrium, and good sense, others become sedate, steady, and  reasonable.  She is the head, nay, rather, the heart of  Christendom--the head is at Rome--through which circulates the  pure and impure blood of the nations.  It is in vain Great  Britain, Germany, or Russia disputes with her the hegemony of  European civilization.  They are forced to yield to her at last,  to be content to revolve around her as 158                                        the centre of the  political system that masters them.  The reason is, France is  more completely and sincerely Roman than any other nation.  The  revolutions that have shaken the world have resulted in  eliminating the barbaric elements she had retained, and clearing  away all obstacles to the complete triumph of Imperial Rome.   Napoleon III. is for France what Augustus was for Rome.  The  revolutions in Spain and Italy have only swept away the relics of  the barbaric constitution, and aided the revival of Roman  imperialism.  In no country do the revolutionists succeed in  establishing their own theories; Caesar remains master of the  field.  Even in the United States, a revolution undertaken in  favor of the barbaric system has resulted in the destruction of  what remained of that system--in sweeping away the last relics of  disintegrating feudalism, and in the complete establishment of  the Graeco-Roman system, with important improvements, in the New  World.

The Roman system is republican, in the broad sense of the term,  because under it power is never an estate, never the private  for the public good.  As it existed under the Caesars, and is  revived in modern times, whether under the 159                                            imperial or the  democratic form, it, no doubt, tends to centralism, to the  concentration of all the powers and forces of the state in one  central government, from which all local authorities and  institutions emanate.  Wise men oppose it as affording no  guaranties to individual liberty against the abuses of power.   This it may not do, but the remedy is not in feudalism.  The  feudal lord holds his authority as an estate, and has over the  people under him all the power of Caesar and all the rights of  the proprietor.  He, indeed, has a guaranty against his  liege-lord, sometimes a more effective guaranty than his  liege-lord has against him; but against his centralized power his  vassals and serfs have only the guaranty that a slave has against  his owner.

Feudalism is alike hostile to the freedom of public authority and  of the people.  It is essentially a disintegrating element in the  nation.  It breaks the unity and individuality of the state,  embarrasses the sovereign, and guards against the abuse of public  authority by overpowering and suppressing it.  Every feudal lord  is a more thorough despot in his own domain than Caesar ever was  or could be in the empire; and the monarch, even if strong enough,  is yet not competent to intervene between him and his  160                                                       people, any  more than the General government in the United States was to  intervene between the negro slave and his master.  The great  vassals of the crown singly, or, if not singly, in  combination--and they could always combine in the interest of  their order--were too strong for the king, or to be brought under  any public authority, and could issue from their fortified  castles and rob and plunder to their hearts' content, with none  to call them to an account.  Under the most thoroughly  centralized government there is far more liberty for the people,  and a far greater security for person and property, except in the  case of the feudal nobles themselves, than was even dreamed of  while the feudal regime was in full vigor.  Nobles were  themselves free, it is conceded, but not the people.  The king  was too weak, too restricted in his action by the feudal  constitution to reach them, and the higher clergy were ex officio  sovereigns, princes, barons, or feudal lords, and were led by  their private interests to act with the feudal nobility, save  when that nobility threatened the temporalities of the church.   The only reliance, under God, left in feudal times to the poor  people was in the lower ranks of the clergy, especially of the  regular clergy.  All the great German emperors in the twelfth and 161 thirteenth centuries, who saw the evils of feudalism, and  attempted to break it up and revive imperial Rome, became  involved in quarrels with the chiefs of the religious society,  and failed, because the interest of the Popes, as feudal  sovereigns and Italian princes, and the interests of the  dignified clergy, were for the time bound up with the feudal  society, though their Roman culture and civilization made them at  heart hostile to it.  The student of history, however strong his  filial affection towards the visible head of the church, cannot  help admiring the grandeur of the political views of Frederic the  Second, the greatest and last of the Hohenstaufen, or refrain  from dropping a tear over his sad failure.  He had great faults  as a man, but he had rare genius as a statesman; and it is some  consolation to know that he died a Christian death, in charity  with all men, after having received the last sacraments of his  religion.

The Popes, under the circumstances, were no doubt justified in  the policy they pursued, for the Swabian emperors failed to  respect the acknowledged rights of the church, and to remember  their own incompetency in spirituals; but evidently their  political views and aims were liberal, far-reaching, and worthy  of admiration. 162                 Their success, if it could have been effected  without lesion to the church, would have set Europe forward some  two or three hundred years, and probably saved it from the  schisms of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries.  But it is  easy to be wise after the event.  The fact is, that during the  period when feudalism was in full vigor, the king was merely a  shadow; the people found their only consolation in religion, and  their chief protectors in the monks, who mingled with them, saw  their sufferings, and sympathized with them, consoled them,  carried their cause to the castle before the feudal lord and  lady, and did, thank God, do something to keep alive religious  sentiments and convictions in the bosom of the feudal society  itself.  Whatever opinions may be formed of the monastic orders  in relation to the present, this much is certain, that they were  the chief civilizers of Europe, and the chief agents in  delivering European society from feudal barbarism.

The aristocracy have been claimed as the natural allies of the  throne, but history proves them to be its natural enemies,  whenever it cannot be used in their service, and kings do not  consent to be their ministers and to do their bidding.  A  political aristocracy has at heart 163                                    only the interests of its  order, and pursues no line of policy but the extension or  preservation of its privileges.  Having little to gain and much  to lose, it opposes every political change that would either  strengthen the crown or elevate the people.  The nobility in the  French Revolution were the first to desert both the king and the  kingdom, and kings have always found their readiest and firmest  allies in the people.  The people in Europe have no such bitter  feelings towards royalty as they have towards the feudal  nobility--for kings have never so grievously oppressed them.  In  Rome the patrician order opposed alike the emperor and the  people, except when they, as chivalric nobles sometimes will do,  turned courtiers or demagogues.  They were the people of Rome and  the provinces that sustained the emperors, and they were the  emperors who sustained the people, and gave to the provincials  the privileges of Roman citizens.

Guaranties against excessive centralism are certainly needed, but  the statesman will not seek them in the feudal organization of  society--in a political aristocracy, whether founded on birth or  private wealth, nor in a privileged class of any sort.  Better  trust Caesar than Brutus, or even Cato.  Nor will he seek them 164                                                                in  the antagonism of interests intended to neutralize or balance  each other, as in the English constitution.  This was the great  error of Mr. Calhoun.  No man saw more clearly than Mr. Calhoun  the utter worthlessness of simple paper constitutions, on which  Mr. Jefferson placed such implicit reliance, or that the real  constitution is in the state itself, in the manner in which the  people themselves are organized; but his reliance was in  constituting, as powers in the state, the several popular  interests that exist, and pitting them against each other--the  famous system of checks and balances of English states men.  He  was led to this, because be distrusted power, and was more  intention guarding against its abuses than on providing for its  free, vigorous, and healthy action, going on the principle that  "that is the best government which governs least." But, if the  opposing interests could be made to balance one another perfectly,  the result would be an equilibrium, in which power would be  brought to a stand-still; and if not, the stronger would succeed  and swallow up all the rest.  The theory of checks and balances  is admirable if the object be to trammel power, and to have as  little power in the government as possible; but it is a theory  which is born from passions engendered by the struggle against 165 despotism or arbitrary power, not from a calm and philosophical  appreciation of government itself.  The English have not  succeeded in establishing their theory, for, after all, their  constitution does not work so well as they pretend.  The landed  interest controls at one time, and the mercantile and  manufacturing interest at another.  They do not perfectly balance  one another, and it is not difficult to see that the mercantile  and manufacturing interest, combined with the moneyed interest,  is henceforth to predominate.  The aim of the real statesman is  to organize all the interests and forces of the state  dialectically, so that they shall unite to add to its strength,  and work together harmoniously for the common good.





166 CHAPTER VIII.

CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT-CONCLUDED.


Though the constitution of the people is congenital, like the  constitution of an individual, and cannot be radically changed  without the destruction of the state, it must not be supposed  that it is wholly withdrawn from the action of the reason and  free-will of the nation, nor from that of individual statesmen.   All created things are subject to the law of development, and may  be developed either in a good sense or in a bad; that is, may be  either completed or corrupted.  All the possibilities of the  national constitution are given originally in the birth of the  nation, as all the possibilities of mankind were given in the  first man.  The germ must be given in the original constitution.   But in all constitutions there is more than one element, and the  several elements maybe developed pari passu, or unequally, one  having the ascendency and suppressing the rest.  In the original  constitution of Rome the patrician ele- 167                                       ment was dominant, showing  that the patriarchal organization of society still retained no  little force.  The king was only the presiding officer of the  senate and the leader of the army in war.  His civil functions  corresponded very nearly to those of a mayor of the city of New  York, where all the effective power is in the aldermen, common  council, and heads of departments.  Except in name he was little  else than a pageant.  The kings, no doubt, labored to develop and  extend the royal element of the constitution.  This was natural;  and it was equally natural that they should be resisted by the  patricians.  Hence when the Tarquins, or Etruscan dynasty,  undertook to be kings in fact as well as in name, and seemed  likely to succeed, the patricians expelled them, and supplied  their place by two consuls annually elected.  Here was a  modification, but no real change of the constitution.  The  effective Power, as before, remained in the senate.

But there was from early times a plebeian element in the  population of the city, though forming at first no part of the  political people.  Their origin is not very certain, nor their  original position in the city.	Historians give different  accounts of them.  But that they should, as they increased in  numbers, wealth,  168                  and importance, demand admission into the  political society, religious or solemn marriage, a voice in the  government, and the faculty of holding civil and military offices,  was only in the order of regular development.  At first the  patricians fought them, and, failing to subdue them by force,  effected a compromise, and bought up their leaders.  The  concession which followed of the tribunitial veto was only a  further development.  By that veto the plebeians gained no  initiative, no positive power, indeed, but their tribunes, by  interposing it, could stop the proceedings of the government.   They could not propose the measures they liked, but they could  prevent the legal adoption of measures they disliked--a faculty  Mr. Calhoun asserted for the several States of the American Union  in his doctrine of nullification, or State veto, as he called it.   It was simply an obstructive power.

But from a power to obstruct legislative action to the power to  originate or propose it, and force the senate to adopt it through  fear of the veto of measures the patricians had at heart, was  only a still further development.  This gained, the exclusively  patrician constitution had disappeared, and Marius, the head of a  great plebeian house, could be elected consul  169                                               and the plebeians  in turn threaten to become predominant, which Sylla or Sulla, as  dictator, seeing, tried in vain to prevent.  The dictator was  provided for in the original constitution.  Retain the  dictatorship for a time, strengthen the plebeian element by  ruthless proscriptions of patricians and by recruits from the  provinces, unite the tribunitial, pontifical, and military powers  in the imperator designated by the army, all elements existing in  the constitution from an early day, and already developed in the  Roman state, and you have the imperial constitution, which  retained to the last the senate and consuls, though with less and  less practical power.  These changes are very great, but are none  of them radical, dating from the recognition of	the plebs as  pertaining to the Roman people.  They are normal developments,  not corruptions, and the transition from the consular republic to  the imperial was unquestionably a real social and political  progress.  And yet the Roman people, had they chosen, could have  given a different direction to the developments of their  constitution.  There was Providence in the course of events, but  no fatalism.

Sulla was a true patrician, a blind partisan of the past.  He  sought to arrest the plebeian development led by Marius, and to  restore the 170             exclusively patrician government.  But it was too late.   His proscriptions, confiscations, butcheries, unheard-of cruelties  which anticipated and surpassed those of the French Revolution of  1793, availed nothing.  The Marian or plebeian movement,  apparently checked for a moment, resumed its march with renewed  vigor under Julius, and triumphed at Pharsalia.  In vain Cicero,  only accidentally associated with the patrician party, which  distrusted him--in vain Cicero declaims, Cato scolds, or parades  his impractical virtues, Brutus and Cassius seize the assassin's  dagger, and strike to the earth "the foremost man of all the  world;" the plebeian cause moves on with resistless force,  triumphs anew at Philippi, and young Octavius avenges the murder  of his uncle, and proves to the world that the assassination of a  ruler is a blunder as well as a crime.  In vain does Mark Antony  desert the movement, rally Egypt and the barbaric East, and seek  to transfer the seat of empire from the Tiber to the banks of the  Nile or the Orontes; plebeian and imperial Rome wins a final  victory at Actium, and definitively secures the empire of the  civilized world to the West.

Thus far the developments were normal, and advanced civilization.   But Rome still retained  171                         the barbaric element of slavery in her  bosom, and had conquered more barbaric nations than she had  assimilated.  These nations she at first governed as tributary  states, with their own constitutions and national chiefs;  afterwards as Roman provinces, by her own proconsuls and prefects.   When the emperors threw open the gates of the city to the  provincials, and conceded them the rights and privileges of Roman  citizens, they introduced not only a foreign element into the  state, destitute of Roman patriotism, but the barbaric and  despotic elements retained by the conquered nations as yet only  partially assimilated.  These elements became germs of  anti-republican developments, rather of corruptions, and prepared  the downfall of the empire.  Doubtless these corruptions might  have been arrested, and would have been, if Roman patriotism had  survived the changes effected in the Roman population by the  concession of Roman citizenship to provincials; but it did not,  and they were favored as time went on by the emperors themselves,  and more especially by Dioclesian, a real barbarian, who hated  Rome, and by Constantine, surnamed the Great, a real despot, who  converted the empire from a republican to a despotic empire.   Rome fell from the force of barba- 172                                  rism developed from within, far  more than from the force of the barbarians hovering on her  frontiers and invading her provinces.

The law of all possible developments is in the providential or  congenital constitution; but these possible developments are many  and various, and the reason and free-will of the nation as well  as of individuals are operative in determining which of them  shall be adopted.  The nation, under the direction of wise and  able statesmen who understood their age and country, who knew how  to discern between normal developments and barbaric corruptions,  placed at the head of affairs in season, might have saved Rome  from her fate, eliminated the barbaric and assimilated the  foreign elements, and preserved Rome as a Christian and  republican empire to this day, and saved the civilized world from  the ten centuries of barbarism which followed her conquest by the  barbarians of the North.  But it rarely happens that the real  statesmen of a nation are placed at the head of affairs.

Rome did not fall in consequence of the strength of her external  enemies, nor through the corruption of private morals and manners,  which was never greater than under the first Triumvirate.  She  fell from the want of true  173                            statesmanship in her public men, and  patriotism in her people.  Private virtues and private vices are  of the last consequence to individuals, both here and hereafter;  but private virtues never saved, private vices never ruined a  nation.  Edward the Confessor was a saint, and yet be prepared  the way for the Norman conquest of England; and France owes  infinitely less to St. Louis than to Louis XI., Richelieu, and  Napoleon, who, though no saints, were statesmen.  What is  specially needed in statesmen is public spirit, intelligence,  foresight, broad views, manly feelings, wisdom, energy,  resolution; and when statesmen with these qualities are placed at  the head of affairs, the state, if not already lost, can, however  far gone it may be, be recovered, restored, reinvigorated,  advanced, and private vice and corruption disappear in the  splendor of public virtue.  Providence is always present in the  affairs of nations, but not to work miracles to counteract the  natural effects of the ignorance, ineptness, short-sightedness,  narrow views, public stupidity, and imbecility of rulers, because  they are irreproachable and saintly in their private characters  and relations, as was Henry VI. of England, or, in some respects,  Louis XVI. of France.  Providence is God intervening through 174                                                              the  laws he by his creative act gives to creatures, not their  suspension or abrogation.  It was the corruption of the  statesmen, in substituting the barbaric element for the proper  Roman, to which no one contributed more than Constantine, the  first Christian emperor, that was the real cause of the downfall  of Rome, and the centuries of barbarism that followed, relieved  only by the superhuman zeal and charity of the church to save  souls and restore civilization.

But in the constitution of the government, as distinguished from  the state, the nation is freer and more truly sovereign.  The  constitution of the state is that which gives to the people of a  given territory political existence, unity, and individuality,  and renders it capable of political action.  It creates political  or national solidarity, in imitation of the solidarity of the  race, in which it has its root.  It is the providential charter  of national existence, and that which gives to each nation its  peculiar character, and distinguishes it from every other nation.   The constitution of government is the constitution by the  sovereign authority of the nation of an agency or ministry for  the management of its affairs, and the letter of instructions  according to which the agent or minister is to 175                                                act and conduct  the matters intrusted to him.  The distinction which the English  make between the sovereign and the ministry is analogous to that  between the state and the government, only they understand by the  sovereign the king or queen, and by the ministry the executive,  excluding, or not decidedly including, the legislature and the  judiciary.  The sovereign is the people as the state or body  politic, and as the king holds from God only through the people,  he is not properly sovereign, and is to be ranked with the  ministry or government.  Yet when the state delegates the full or  chief governing power to the king, and makes him its sole or  principal representative, he may, with sufficient accuracy for  ordinary purposes, be called sovereign.  Then, understanding by  the ministry or government the legislative and judicial, as well  as the executive functions, whether united in one or separated  into distinct and mutually independent departments, the English  distinction will express accurately enough, except for strictly  scientific purposes, the distinction between the state and the  government.

Still, it is only in despotic states, which are not founded on  right, but force, that the king can say, L'etat, c'est moi, I am  the state; and 176                Shakespeare's usage of calling the king of France  simply France, and the king of England simply England, smacks of  feudalism, under which monarchy is an estate, property, not a  public trust.  It corresponds to the Scottish usage of calling  the proprietor by the name of his estate.  It is never to be  forgotten that in republican states the king has only a delegated  sovereignty, that the people, as well as God, are above him.  He  holds his power, as the Emperor of the French professes to hold  his, by the grace of God and the national will--the only title by  which a king or emperor can legitimately hold power.

The king or emperor not being the state, and the government,  whatever its form or constitution, being a creature of the state,  he can be dethroned, and the whole government even virtually  overthrown, without dissolving the state or the political society.   Such an event may cause much evil, create much social confusion,  and do grave injury to the nation, but the political society may  survive it; the sovereign remains in the plenitude of his rights,  as competent to restore government as be was originally to  institute it.  When, in 1848, Louis Philippe was dethroned by the  Parisian mob, and fled the kingdom, there was in France no 177 legitimate government, for all commissions ran in the king's  name; but the organic or territorial people of France, the body  politic, remained, and in it remained the sovereign power to  organize and appoint a new government.  When, on the 2d of  December, 1851, the president, by a coup d'etat, suppressed the  legislative assembly and the constitutional government, there was  no legitimate government standing, and the power assumed by the  president was unquestionably a usurpation; but the nation was  competent to condone his usurpation and legalize his power, and  by a plebiscitum actually did so.  The wisdom or justice of the  coup d'etat is another question, about which men may differ; but  when the French nation, by its subsequent act, had condoned it,  and formally conferred dictatorial powers on the prince-president,  the principal had approved the act of his agent, and given him  discretionary powers, and nothing more was to be said.  The  imperial constitution and the election of the president to be  emperor, that followed on December 2d, 1852, were strictly legal,  and, whatever men may think of Napoleon III., it must be conceded  that there is no legal flaw in his title, and that he holds his  power by a 178            title as high and as perfect as there is for any  prince or ruler.

But the plebiscitum cannot be legally appealed to or be valid  when and where there is a legal government existing and in the  full exercise of its constitutional functions, as was decided by  the Supreme Court of the United States in a case growing out of  what is known as the Dorr rebellion in Rhode Island.  A suffrage  committee, having no political authority, drew up and presented a  new constitution of government to the people, plead a plebiscitum  in its favor, and claimed the officers elected under it as the  legally elected officers of the state.  The court refused to  recognize the plebiscitum, and decided that it knew Rhode Island  only as represented through the government, which had never  ceased to exist.  New States in Territories have been organized  on the strength of a plebiscitum when the legal Territorial  government was in force, and were admitted as States into the  Union, which, though irregular and dangerous, could be done  without revolution, because Congress, that admitted them, is the  power to grant the permission to organize as States and apply for  admission.  Congress is competent to condone an offence against  its own rights.  The real danger of the 179                                         practice is, that it  tends to create a conviction that sovereignty inheres in the  people individually, or as population, not as the body politic or  organic people attached to a sovereign domain; and the people who  organize under a plebiscitum are not, till organized and admitted  into the Union, an organic or a political people at all.  When  Louis Napoleon made his appeal to a vote of the French people, he  made an appeal to a people existing as a sovereign people, and a  sovereign people without a legal government.  In his case the  plebiscitum was proper and sufficient, even if it be conceded  that it was through his own fault that France at the moment was  found without a legal government.  When a thing is done, though  wrongly done, you cannot act as if it were not done, but must  accept it as a fact and act accordingly.

The plebiscitum, which is simply an appeal to the people outside  of government, is not valid when the government has not lapsed,  either by its usurpations or by its dissolution, nor is it valid  either in the case of a province, or of a population that has no  organic existence as an independent sovereign state.  The  plebiscitum in France was valid, but in the Grand Duchy of  Tuscany, the Duchies of Modena, Parma, and Lucca, and in the  Kingdom of the Two 180                    Sicilies it was not valid, for their legal  governments had not lapsed; nor was it valid in the Aemilian  provinces of the Papal States, because they were not a nation or  a sovereign people, but only a portion of such nation or people.   In the case of the states and provinces--except Lombardy, ceded  to France by Austria, and sold to the Sardinian king--annexed to  Piedmont to form the new kingdom of Italy, the plebiscitum was  invalid, because implying the right of the people to rebel  against the legal authority, and to break the unity and  individuality of the state of which they form an integral part.   The nation is a whole, and no part has the right to secede or  separate, and set up a government for itself, or annex itself to  another state, without the consent of the whole.  The solidarity  of the nation is both a fact and a law.  The secessionists from  the United States defended their action only on the ground that  the States of the American Union are severally independent  sovereign states, and they only obeyed the authority of their  respective states.

The plebiscitum, or irregular appeal to what is called universal  suffrage, since adopted by Louis Napoleon in France after the  coup d'etat, is becoming not a little menacing to the stabil- 181                                                             ity  of governments and the rights and integrity of states, and is not  less dangerous to the peace and order of society than "the  solidarity of peoples" asserted by Kossuth, the revolutionary  ex-governor of Hungary, the last stronghold of feudal barbarism  in Christian Europe; for Russia has emancipated her serfs.

The nation, as sovereign, is free to constitute government  according to its own judgment, under any form it  pleases--monarchical, aristocratic, democratic, or mixed--vest  all power in an hereditary monarch, in a class or hereditary  nobles, in a king and two houses of parliament, one hereditary,  the other elective, or both elective; or it may establish a  single, dual, or triple executive, make all officers of  government hereditary or all elective, and if elective, elective  for a longer or a shorter time, by universal suffrage or a select  body of electors.  Any of these forms and systems, and many  others besides, are or may be legitimate, if established and  maintained by the national will.  There is nothing in the law of  God or of nature, antecedently to the national will, that gives  any one of them a right to the exclusion of any one of the others.   The imperial system in France is as legitimate as the federative  system in the United States.  The only form or system that 182                                                            is  necessarily illegal is the despotic.  That can never be a truly  civilized government, nor a legitimate government, for God has  given to man no dominion over man.  He gave men, as St. Augustine  says, and Pope St. Gregory the Great repeats, dominion over the  irrational creation, not over the rational, and hence the  primitive rulers of men were called pastors or shepherds, not  lords.  It may be the duty of the people subjected to a despotic  government to demean themselves quietly and peaceably towards it,  as a matter of prudence, to avoid sedition, and the evils that  would necessarily follow an attempted revolution, but not  because, founded as it is on mere force, it has itself any right  or legality.

All other forms of government are republican in their essential  constitution, founded on public right, and held under God from  and for the commonwealth, and which of them is wisest and best  for the commonwealth is, for the most part, an idle question.   "Forms of government," somebody has said, "are like shoes--that  is the best form which best fit the feet that are to wear them."   Shoes are to be fitted to the feet, not the feet to the shoes,  and feet vary in size and conformation.  There is, in regard to  government, as distinguished from the state, 183                                              no antecedent right  which binds the people, for antecedently to the existence of the  government as a fact, the state is free to adopt any form that it  finds practicable, or judges the wisest and best for itself.   Ordinarily the form of the government practicable for a nation is  determined by the peculiar providential constitution of the  territorial people, and a form of government that would be  practicable and good in one country may be the reverse in another.   The English government is no doubt the best practicable in Great  Britain, at present at least, but it has proved a failure  wherever else it has been attempted.  The American system has  proved itself, in spite of the recent formidable rebellion to  overthrow it, the best and only practicable government for the  United States, but it is impracticable everywhere else, and all  attempts by any European or other American state to introduce it  can end only in disaster.  The imperial system apparently works  well in France, but though all European states are tending to it,  it would not work well at all on the American continent,  certainly not until the republic of the United States has ceased  to exist.  While the United States remain the great American  power, that system, or its kindred system, democratic centralism,  can 184     never become an American system, as Maximilian's experiment  in Mexico is likely to prove.

Political propagandism, except on the Roman plan, that is, by  annexation and incorporation, is as impracticable as it is  wanting in the respect that one independent people owes to  another.  The old French Jacobins tried to propagate, even with  fire and sword, their system throughout Europe, as the only  system compatible with the rights of man.  The English, since  1688, have been great political propagandists, and at one time it  seemed not unlikely that every European state would try the  experiment of a parliamentary government, composed of an  hereditary crown, an hereditary house of lords, and an elective  house of commons.  The democratic Americans are also great  political propagandists, and are ready to sympathize with any  rebellion, insurrection, or movement in behalf of democracy in  any part of the world, however mean or contemptible, fierce or  bloody it may be; but all this is as unstatesmanlike as unjust;  unstatesmanlike, for no form of government can bear  transplanting, and because every independent nation is the sole  judge of what best comports with its own interests, and its  judgment is to be respected by the citizens as well as by the  gov- 185    ernments of other states.  Religious propagandism is a right  and a duty, because religion is catholic and of universal  obligation; and so is the jus gentium of the Romans, which is  only the application to individuals and nations of the great  principles of natural justice; but no political propagandism is  ever allowable, because no one form of government is catholic in  its nature, or of universal obligation.

Thoughtful Americans are opposed to political propagandism, and  respect the right of every nation to choose its own form of  government; but they hold that the American system is the best in  itself, and that if other nations were as enlightened as the  American, they would adopt it.  But though the American system,  rightly understood, is the best, as they hold, it is not because  other nations are less enlightened, which is by no means a fact,  that they do not adopt, or cannot bear it, but solely because  their providential constitutions do not require or admit it, and  an attempt to introduce it in any of them would prove a failure  and a grave evil.

Fit your shoes to your feet.  The law of the governmental  constitution is in that of the nation.  The constitution of the  government must grow out of the constitution of the state, and 186 accord with the genius, the character, the habits, customs, and  wants of the people, or it will not work well, or tend to secure  the legitimate ends of government.  The constitutions imagined by  philosophers are for Utopia, not for any actual, living,  breathing people.  You must take the state as it is, and develop  your governmental constitution from it, and harmonize it with it.   Where there is a discrepancy between the two constitutions, the  government has no support in the state, in the organic people, or  nation, and can sustain itself only by corruption or physical  force.  A government may be under the necessity of using force to  suppress an insurrection or rebellion against the national  authority, or the integrity of the national territory, but no  government that can sustain itself, not the state, only by  physical force or large standing armies, can be a good government,  or suited to the nation.  It must adopt the most stringent  repressive measures, suppress liberty of speech and of conscience,  outrage liberty in what it has the most intimate and sacred, and  practise the most revolting violence and cruelty, for it can  govern only by terror.  Such a government is unsuited to the  nation.

This is seen in all history: in the attempt of the dictator Sulla  to preserve the old patri- 187                          cian government against the plebeian  power that time and events had developed in the Roman state, and  which was about to gain the supremacy, as we have seen, at  Pharsalia, Philippi, and Actium; in the efforts to establish a  Jacobinical government in France in 1793; in Rome in 1848, and  the government of Victor Emmanuel in Naples in 1860 and 1861.   These efforts, proscriptions, confiscations, military executions,  assassinations, massacres, are all made in the name of liberty,  or in defence of a government supposed to guaranty the well-being  of the state and the rights of the people.  They are rendered  inevitable by the mad attempt to force on a nation a constitution  of government foreign to the national constitution, or repugnant  to the national tastes, interests, habits, convictions, or whole  interior life.  The repressive policy, adopted to a certain  extent by nearly all European governments, grows out of the  madness of a portion of the people of the several states in  seeking to force upon the nation an anti-national constitution.   The sovereigns may not be very wise, but they are wiser, more  national, more patriotic than the mad theorists who seek to  revolutionize the state and establish a government that has no  hold in the national traditions, the national character, or the  188 national life; and the statesman, the patriot, the true friend of  liberty sympathizes with the national authorities, not with the  mad theorists and revolutionists.

The right of a nation to change its form of government, and its  magistrates or representatives, by whatever name called, is  incontestable.  Hence the French constitution of l789, which  involved that of 1793, was not illegal, for though accompanied by  some irregularities, it was adopted by the manifest will of the  nation, and consented to by all orders in the state.  Not its  legality but its wisdom is to be questioned, together with the  false and dangerous theories of government which dictated it.   There is no compact or mutual stipulation between the state and  the government.  The state, under God, is sovereign, and ordains  and establishes the government, instead of making a contract, a  bargain, or covenant, with it.  The common democratic doctrine on  this point is right, if by people is understood the organic  people attached to a sovereign domain, not the people as  individuals or as a floating or nomadic multitude.  By people in  the political sense, Cicero, and St. Augustine after him,  understood the people as the republic, organized in reference to  the common or public good.  With this under- 189                                            standing, the  sovereignty persists in the people, and they retain the supreme  authority over the government.  The powers delegated are still  the powers of the sovereign delegating them, and may be modified,  altered, or revoked, as the sovereign judges proper.  The nation  does not, and cannot abdicate or delegate away its own  sovereignty, for sovereign it is, and cannot but be, so long as  it remains a nation not subjected to another nation.

By the imperial constitution of the French government, the  imperial power is vested in Napoleon III., and made hereditary in  his family, in the male line of his legitimate descendants.  This  is legal, but the nation has not parted with its sovereignty or  bound itself by contract forever to a Napoleonic dynasty.   Napoleon holds the imperial power "by the grace of God and the  will of the nation," which means simply that he holds his  authority from God, through the French people, and is bound to  exercise it according to the law of God and the national will.   The nation is as competent to revoke this constitution as the  legislature is to repeal any law it is competent to enact, and in  doing so breaks no contract, violates no right, for Napoleon and  his descendants hold their right to the imperial throne subject  to the 190        national will from which it is derived.  In case the  nation should revoke the powers delegated, he or they would have  no more valid claim to the throne than have the Bourbons, whom  the nation has unmistakably dismissed from its service.

The only point here to be observed is, that the change must be by  the nation itself, in its sovereign capacity; not by a mob, nor  by a part of the nation conspiring, intriguing, or rebelling,  without any commission from the nation.  The first Napoleon  governed by a legal title, but he was never legally dethroned,  and the government of the Bourbons, whether of the elder branch  or the younger, was never a legal government, for the Bourbons  had lost their original rights by the election of the first  Napoleon, and never afterwards had the national will in their  favor.  The republic of 1848 was legal, in the sense that the  nation acquiesced in it as a temporary necessity; but hardly  anybody believed in it or wanted it, and the nation accepted it  as a sort of locum tenens, rather than willed or ordained it.   Its overthrow by the coup d'etat may not be legally defensible,  but the election of Napoleon III. condoned the illegality, if  there was any, and gave the emperor a legal title, that no  republican, that none but a despot 191                                    or a no-government man can  dispute.  As the will of the nation, in so far as it contravenes  not the law of God or the law of nature, binds every individual  of the nation, no individual or number of individuals has, or can  have, any right to conspire against him, or to labor to oust him  from his place, till his escheat has been pronounced by the voice  of the nation.  The state, in its sovereign capacity, willing it,  is the only power competent to revoke or to change the form and  constitution of the imperial government.  The same must be said  of every nation that has a lawful government; and this, while it  preserves the national sovereignty, secures freedom of progress,  condemns all sedition, conspiracy, rebellion, revolution, as does  the Christian law itself.





192 CHAPTER IX.

THE UNITED STATES


Sovereignty, under God, inheres in the organic people, or the  people as the republic; and every organic people fixed to the  soil, and politically independent of every other people, is a  sovereign people, and, in the modern sense, an independent  sovereign nation.

Sovereign states may unite in an alliance, league, or  confederation, and mutually agree to exercise their sovereign  powers or a portion of them in common, through a common organ or  agency; but in this agreement they part with none of their  sovereignty, and each remains a sovereign state or nation as  before.  The common organ or agency created by the convention is  no state, is no nation, has no inherent sovereignty, and derives  all its vitality and force from the persisting sovereignty of the  states severally that have united in creating it.  The agreement  no more affects the sovereignty of the several states entering  into it, than does the 193                        appointment of an agent affect the rights  and powers of the principal.  The creature takes nothing from the  Creator, exhausts not, lessens not his creative energy, and it is  only by his retaining and continuously exerting his creative  power that the creature continues to exist.

An independent state or nation may, with or without its consent,  lose its sovereignty, but only by being merged in or subjected to  another.  Independent sovereign states cannot by convention, or  mutual agreement, form themselves into a single sovereign state,  or nation.  The compact, or agreement, is made by sovereign  states, and binds by virtue of the sovereign power of each of the  contracting parties.  To destroy that sovereign power would be to  annul the compact, and render void the agreement.  The agreement  can be valid and binding only on condition that each of the  contracting parties retains the sovereignty that rendered it  competent to enter into the compact, and states that retain  severally their sovereignty do not form a single sovereign state  or nation.  The states in convention cannot become a new and  single sovereign state, unless they lose their several  sovereignty, and merge it in the new sovereignty; but this they  cannot do by agreement, because the moment the parties to the  agreement cease 194                 to be sovereign, the agreement, on which alone  depends the new sovereign state, is vacated, in like manner as a  contract is vacated by the death of the contracting parties.

That a nation may voluntarily cede its sovereignty is frankly  admitted, but it can cede it only to something or somebody  actually existing, for to cede to nothing and not to cede is one  and the same thing.  They can part with their own sovereignty by  merging themselves in another national existence, but not by  merging themselves in nothing; and, till they have parted with  their own sovereignty, the new sovereign state does not exist.  A  prince can abdicate his power, because by abdicating he simply  gives back to the people the trust he had received from them; but  a nation cannot, save by merging itself in another.  An  independent state not merged in another, or that is not subject  to another, cannot cease to be a sovereign nation, even if it  would.

That no sovereign state can be formed by a agreement or compact  has already been shown in the refutation of the theory of the  origin of government in convention, or the so-called social  compact.  Sovereign states are as unable to form themselves into  a single sovereign state by mutual compact as are the sovereign  individ- 195        uals imagined by Rousseau.  The convention, either of  sovereign states or of sovereign individuals, with the best will  in the world, can form only a compact or agreement between  sovereigns, and an agreement or compact, whatever its terms or  conditions, is only an alliance, a league, or a confederation,  which no one can pretend is a sovereign state, nation, or  republic.

The question, then, whether the United States are a single  sovereign state or nation, or a confederacy of independent  sovereign states depends on the question whether the American  people originally existed as one people or as several independent  states.  Mr. Jefferson maintains that before the convention of  1787 they existed as several independent sovereign states, but  that since that convention, or the ratification of the  constitution it proposed, they exist as one political people in  regard to foreign nations, and several sovereign states in regard  to their internal and domestic relations.  Mr. Webster concedes  that originally the States existed as severally sovereign states,  but contends that by ratifying the constitution they have been  made one sovereign political people, state, or nation, and that  the General government is a supreme national government, though  with a reservation in favor of State rights.  But both  196                                                        are wrong.   If the several States of the Union were severally sovereign  states when they met in the convention, they are so now; and the  constitution is only an agreement or compact between sovereigns,  and the United States are, as Mr. Calhoun maintained, only a  confederation of sovereign states, and not a single state or one  political community.

But if the sovereignty persists in the States severally, any  State, saving its faith, may whenever it chooses to do so,  withdraw from the Union, absolve its subjects from all obligation  to the Federal authorities, and make it treason in them to adhere  to the Federal government.  Secession is, then, an incontestable  right; not a right held under the constitution or derived from  the convention but a right held prior to it, independently of it,  inherent in the State sovereignty, and inseparable from it.  The  State is bound by the constitution of the Union only while she is  in it, and is one of the States united.  In ratifying the  constitution she did not part with her sovereignty, or with any  portion of it, any more than France has parted with her  sovereignty, and ceased to be an independent sovereign nation, by  vesting the imperial power in Napoleon III. and his legitimate  heirs male.  The principal parts not with his power 197                                                     to his agent,  for the agent is an agent only by virtue of the continued power  of the principal.  Napoleon is emperor by the will of the French  people, and governs only by the authority of the French nation,  which is as competent to revoke the powers it has conferred on  him, when it judges proper, as it was to confer them.  The Union  exists and governs, if the States are sovereign, only by the will  of the State, and she is as competent to revoke the powers she  has delegated as she was to delegate them.  The, Union, as far as  she is concerned, is her creation, and what she is competent to  make she is competent to unmake.

In seceding or withdrawing from the Union a State may act very  unwisely, very much against her own interests and the interests  of the other members of the confederacy; but, if sovereign, she  in doing so only exercises her unquestionable right.  The other  members may regret her action, both for her sake and their own,  but they cannot accuse her or her citizens of disloyalty in  seceding, nor of rebellion, if in obedience to her authority they  defend their independence by force of arms against the Union.   Neither she nor they, on the supposition, ever owed allegiance to  the Union.  Allegiance is due from the citizen to the sovereign  state, but never from 198                       a sovereign state or from its citizens to  any other sovereign state.  While the State is in the Union the  citizen owes obedience to the United States, but only because his  State has, in ratifying the Federal constitution, enacted that it  and all laws and treaties made under it shall be law within her  territory.  The repeal by the State of the act of ratification  releases the citizen from the obligation even of obedience, and  renders it criminal for him to yield it without her permission.

It avails nothing, on the hypothesis of the sovereignty of the  States as distinguished from that of the United States, to appeal  to the language or provisions of the Federal constitution.  That  constitutes the government, not the state or the sovereign.  It  is ordained by the sovereign, and if the States were severally  independent and sovereign states, that sovereign is the States  severally, not the States united.  The constitution is law for  the citizens of a State only so long as the State remains one of  the United States.  No matter, then, how clear and express the  language, or stringent the provisions of the constitution, they  bind only the citizens of the States that enact the constitution.   The written constitution is simply a compact, and obliges only  while the compact is continued by the 199                                       States, each for itself.   The sovereignty of the United States as a single or political  people must be established before any thing in the constitution  can be adduced as denying the right of secession.

That this doctrine would deprive the General government of all  right to enforce the laws of the Union on a State that secedes,  or the citizens thereof, is no doubt true; that it would weaken  the central power and make the Union a simple voluntary  association of states, no better than a rope of sand, is no less  true; but what then?  It is simply saying that a confederation is  inferior to a nation, and that a federal government lacks many of  the advantages of a national government.  Confederacies are  always weak in the centre, always lack unity, and are liable to  be dissolved by the influence of local passions, prejudices, and  interests.  But if the United States are a confederation of  states or nations, not a single nation or sovereign state, then  there is no remedy.

If the Anglo-American colonies, when their independence of Great  Britain was achieved and acknowledged, were severally sovereign  states, it has never since been in their power to unite and form  a single sovereign state, or to form themselves into one  indivisible sovereign 200                       nation.  They could unite only by mutual agreement, which gives only a confederation, in which each  retains its own sovereignty, as two individuals, however closely  united, retain each his own individuality.  No sovereignty is of  conventional origin, and none can emerge from the convention that  did not enter it.  Either the states are one sovereign people or  they are not.  If they are not, it is undoubtedly a great  disadvantage; but a disadvantage that must be accepted, and  submitted to without a murmur.

Whether the United States are one sovereign people or only a  confederation is a question of very grave importance.  If they  are only a confederation of states--and if they ever were  severally sovereign states, only a confederation they certainly  are--state secession is an inalienable right, and the government  has had no right to make war on the secessionists as rebels, or  to treat them, when their military power is broken, as traitors,  or disloyal persons.  The honor of the government, and of the  people who have sustained it, is then deeply compromised.

What then is the fact?  Are the United States politically one  people, nation, state, or republic, or are they simply  independent sovereign states united in close and intimate  alliance, league, or federation, by a mutual pact or 201                                                      agreement?   Were the people of the United States who ordained and established  the written constitution one people, or were they not?  If they  were not before ordaining and establishing the government, they  are not now; for the adoption of the constitution did not and  could not make them one.  Whether they are one or many is then  simply a question of fact, to be decided by the facts in the  case, not by the theories of American statesmen, the opinion of  jurists, or even by constitutional law itself.  The old Articles  of Conferation and the later Constitution can serve here only as  historical documents.  Constitutions and laws presuppose the  existence of a national sovereign from which they emanate, and  that ordains them, for they are the formal expression of a  sovereign will.  The nation must exist as an historical fact,  prior to the possession or exercise of sovereign power, prior to  the existence of written Constitutions and laws of any kind, and  its existence must be established before they can be recognized  as having any legal force or vitality.

The existence of any nation, as an independent sovereign nation,  is a purely historical fact, for its right to exist as such is in  the simple fact that it does so exist.  A nation de facto is a  nation de jure, and when we have ascertained 202                                              the fact, we have  ascertained the right.  There is no right in the case separate  from the fact--only the fact must be really a fact.  A people  hitherto a part of another people, or subject to another  sovereign, is not in fact a nation, because they have declared  themselves independent, and have organized a government, and are  engaged in what promises to be a successful struggle for  independence.  The struggle must be practically over; the former  sovereign must have practically abandoned the effort to reduce  them to submission, or to bring them back under his authority,  and if he continues it, does it as a matter of mere form; the  postulant must have proved his ability to maintain civil  government, and to fulfil within and without the obligations  which attach to every civilized nation, before it can be  recognized as an independent sovereign nation; because before it  is not a fact that it is a sovereign nation.  The prior  sovereign, when no longer willing or able to vindicate his right,  has lost it, and no one is any longer bound to respect it, for  humanity demands not martyrs to lost causes.

This doctrine may seem harsh, and untenable even, to those sickly  philanthropists who are always weeping over extinct or oppressed 203 nationalities; but nationality in modern civilization is a fact,  not a right antecedent to the fact.  The repugnance felt to this  assertion arises chiefly from using the word nation sometimes in  a strictly political sense, and sometimes in its original sense  of tribe, and understanding by it not simply the body politic,  but a certain relation of origin, family, kindred, blood, or  race.  But God has made of one blood, or race, all the nations of  men; and, besides, no political rights are founded by the law of  nature on relations of blood, kindred, or family.  Under the  patriarchal or tribal system, and, to some extent, under  feudalism, these relations form the basis of government, but they  are economical relations rather than civil or political, and,  under Christian and modern civilization, are restricted to the  household, are domestic relations, and enter not the state or  body politic, except by way of reminiscence or abuse.  They are  protected by the state, but do not found or constitute it.  The  vicissitudes of time, the revolutions of states and empires,  migration, conquest, and intermixture of families and races, have  rendered it impracticable, even if it were desirable, to  distribute people into nations according to their relations of  blood or descent.

204 There is no civilized nation now existing that has been,  developed from a common ancestor this side of Adam, and the most  mixed are the most civilized.  The nearer a nation approaches to  a primitive people of pure unmixed blood, the farther removed it  is from civilization.  All civilized nations are political  nations, and are founded in the fact, not on rights antecedent to  the fact.  A hundred or more lost nationalities went to form the  Roman empire, and who can tell us how many layers of crushed  nationalities, superposed one upon another, serve for the  foundation of the present French, English, Russian, Austrian, or  Spanish nationalities?  What other title to independence and  sovereignty, than the fact, can you plead in behalf of any  European nation?  Every one has absorbed and extinguished--no one  can say how many--nationalities, that once had as good a right to  be as it has, or can have.  Whether those nationalities have been  justly extinguished or not, is no question for the statesman; it  is the secret of Providence.  Failure in this world is not always  a proof of wrong; nor success, of right.  The good is sometimes  overborne, and the bad sometimes triumphs; but it is  consoling, and even just, to believe that the good oftener  triumphs than the bad.

205 In the political order, the fact, under God, precedes the law.   The nation holds not from the law, but the law holds from the  nation.  Doubtless the courts of every civilized nation recognize  and apply both the law of nature and the law of nations, but only  on the ground that they are included, or are presumed to be  included, in the national law, or jurisprudence.  Doubtless, too,  the nation holds from God, under the law of nature, but only by  virtue of the fact that it is a nation; and when it is a nation  dependent on no other, it holds from God all the rights and  powers of any independent sovereign nation.  There is no right  behind the fact needed to legalize the fact, or to put the nation  that is in fact a nation in possession of full national rights.   In the case of a new nation, or people, lately an integral part  of another people, or subject to another people@ the right of the  prior sovereign must be extinguished indeed, but the extinction  of that right is necessary to complete the fact, which otherwise  would be only an initial, inchoate fact, not a fait accompli.   But that right ceases when its claimant, willingly or  unwillingly, formally or virtually, abandons it; and he does so  when he practically abandons the struggle, and shows no ability  or intention 206              of soon renewing it with any reasonable prospect of  success.

The notion of right, independent of the fact as applied to  sovereignty, is founded in error.  Empty titles to states and  kingdoms are of no validity.  The sovereignty is, under God, in  the nation and the title and the possession are inseparable.  The  title of the Palaeologi to the Roman Empire of the East, of the  king of Sicily, the king of Sardinia, or the king of Spain--for  they are all claimants--to the kingdom of Jerusalem founded by  Godfrey and his crusaders, of the Stuarts to the thrones of  England, Ireland, and Scotland, or of the Bourbons to the throne  of France, are vacated and not worth the parchment on which they  are engrossed.  The contrary opinion, so generally entertained,  belongs to barbarism, not to civilization.  It is in modern  society a relic of feudalism, which places the state in the  government, and makes the government a private estate--a private,  and not a public right--a right to govern the public, not a right  to govern held from or by the public.

The proprietor may be dispossessed in fact of his estate by  violence, by illegal or unjust means, without losing his right,  and another may usurp it, occupy it, and possess it in fact  without acquiring any right or legal title to it. 207                                                    The man who  holds the legal title has the right to oust him and re-enter upon  his estate whenever able to do so.  Here, in the economical  order, the fact and the right are distinguishable, and the actual  occupant may be required to show his title-deeds.  Holding  sovereignty to be a private estate, the feudal lawyers very  properly distinguish between governments de facto and governments  de jure, and argue very logically that violent dispossession of a  prince does not invalidate his title.  But sovereignty, it has  been shown, is not in the government, but in the state, and the  state is inseparable from the public domain.  The people  organized and held by the domain or national territory, are under  God the sovereign nation, and remain so as long as the nation  subsists without subjection to another.  The government, as  distinguished from the state or nation, has only a delegated  authority, governs only by a commission from the nation.  The  revocation of the commission vacates, its title and extinguishes  its rights.  The nation is always sovereign, and every organic  people fixed to the soil, and actually independent of every  other, is a nation.  There can then be no independent nation de  facto that is not an independent nation de jure, nor de jure that  is not de facto.  The moment a 208                                people cease to be an independent  nation in fact, they cease to be sovereign, and the moment they  become in fact an independent nation, they are so of right.   Hence in the political order the fact and the right are born and  expire together; and when it is proved that a people, are in fact  an independent nation, there is no question to be asked as to  their right to be such nation.

In the case of the United States there is only the question of  fact.  If they are in fact one people they are so in right,  whatever the opinions and theories of statesmen, or even the  decisions of courts; for the courts hold from the national  authority, and the theories and opinions of statesmen may be  erroneous.  Certain it is that the States in the American Union  have never existed and acted as severally sovereign states.   Prior to independence, they were colonies under the sovereignty  of Great Britain, and since independence they have existed and  acted only as states united.  The colonists, before separation  and independence, were British subjects, and whatever rights the  colonies had they held by charter or concession from the British  crown.  The colonists never pretended to be other than British  subjects, and the alleged ground of their complaint against the  mother country was not that she had violated their 209                                                    natural rights  as men, but their rights as British subjects--rights, as  contended by the colonists, secured by the English constitution  to all Englishmen or British su6jects.  The denial to them of  these common rights of Englishmen they called tyranny, and they  defended themselves in throwing off their allegiance to George III.,  on the ground that he had, in their regard, become a tyrant, and  the tyranny of the prince absolves the subject from his  allegiance.

In the Declaration of Independence they declared themselves  independent states indeed, but not severally independent.  The  declaration was not made by the states severally, but by the  states jointly, as the United States.  They unitedly declared  their independence; they carried on the war for independence, won  it, and were acknowledged by foreign powers and by the mother  country as the United States, not as severally independent  sovereign states.  Severally they have never exercised the full  powers of sovereign states; they have had no flag--symbol of  sovereignty--recognized by foreign powers, have made no foreign  treaties, held no foreign relations, had no commerce foreign or  interstate, coined no money, entered into no alliances or  confederacies with foreign states or with one another, and in  several re- 210           spects have been more restricted in their powers in the  Union than they were as British colonies.

Colonies are initial or inchoate states, and become complete  states by declaring and winning their independence; and if the  English colonies, now the United States, had separately declared  and won their independence, they would unquestionably have become  separately independent states, each invested by the law of nature  with all the rights and powers of a sovereign nation.  But they  did not do this.  They declared and won their independence  jointly, and have since existed and exercised sovereignty only as  states united, or the United States, that is, states sovereign in  their union, but not in their separation.  This is of itself  decisive of the whole question.

But the colonists have not only never exercised the full powers  of sovereignty save as citizens of states united, therefore as  one people, but they were, so far as a people at all, one people  even before independence.  The colonies were all erected and  endowed with their rights and powers by one and the same national  authority, and the colonists were subjects of one and the same  national sovereign.  Mr. Quincy Adams, who almost alone among our  prominent statesmen maintains the unity of 211                                            the colonial people,  adds indeed to their subjection to the same sovereign authority,  community of origin, of language, manners, customs, and law.  All  these, except the last, or common law, may exist without national  unity in the modern political sense of the term nation.  The  English common law was recognized by the colonial courts, and in  force in all the colonies, not by virtue of colonial legislation,  but by virtue of English authority, as expressed in English  jurisprudence.  The colonists were under the Common Law, because  they were Englishmen, and subjects of the English sovereign.   This proves that they were really one people with the English  people, though existing in a state of colonial dependence, and  not a separate people having nothing politically in common with  them but in the accident of having the same royal person for  their king.  The union with the mother country was national, not  personal, as was the union existing between England and Hanover,  or that still existing between the empire of Austria, formerly  Germany, and the kingdom of Hungary; and hence the British  parliament claimed, and not illegally, the right to tax the  colonies for the support of the empire, and to bind them in all  cases whatsoever--a claim the colonies them- 212                                            selves admitted in  principle by recognizing and observing the British navigation  laws.  The people of the several colonies being really one people  before independence, in the sovereignty of the mother country,  must be so still, unless they have since, by some valid act,  divided themselves or been divided into separate and independent  states.

The king, say the jurists, never dies, and the heralds cry, "The  king is dead!  Live the king!" Sovereignty never lapses, is never  in abeyance, and the moment it ceases in one people it is renewed  in another.  The British sovereignty ceased in the colonies with  independence, and the American took its place.  Did the  sovereignty, which before independence was in Great Britain, pass  from Great Britain to the States severally, or to the States  united?  It might have passed to them severally, but did it?  There is no question of law or antecedent right in the case, but  a simple question of fact, and the fact is determined by  determining who it was that assumed it, exercised it, and has  continued to exercise it.  As to this there is no doubt.  The  sovereignty as a fact has been assumed and exercised by the  United States, the States united, and never by the States  separately or severally.  Then as a fact the sover- 213                                                   eignty that  before independence was in Great Britain, passed, on independence  to the States united, and reappears in all its vigor in the  United States, the only successor to Great Britain known to or  recognized by the civilized world.

As the colonial people were, though distributed in distinct  colonies, still one people, the people of the United States,  though distributed into distinct and mutually independent States,  are yet one sovereign people, therefore a sovereign state or  nation, and not a simple league or confederacy of nations.

There is no doubt that all the powers exercised by the General  Government, though embracing all foreign relations and all  general interests and relations of all the States, might have  been exercised by it under the authority of a mutual compact of  the several States, and practically the difference between the  compact theory and the national view would be very little, unless  in cases like that of secession.  On the supposition that the  American people are one political people, the government would  have the right to treat secession, in the sense in which the  seceders understand it, as rebellion, and to suppress it by  employing all the physical force at its command; but on the  compact 214         theory it would have no such right.  But the question now  under discussion turns simply on what has been and is the  historical fact.  Before the States could enter into the compact  and delegate sovereign powers to the Union, they must have  severally possessed them.  It is historically certain that they  did not possess them before independence; they did not obtain  them by independence, for they did not severally succeed to the  British sovereignty, to which they succeeded only as States  united.  When, then, and by what means did they or could they  become severally sovereign States?  The United States having  succeeded to the British sovereignty in the Anglo-American  colonies, they came into possession of full national sovereignty,  and have alone held and exercised it ever since independence  became a fact.  The States severally succeeding only to the  colonies, never held, and have never been competent to delegate  sovereign powers.

The old Articles of Confederation, it is conceded, were framed on  the assumption that the States are severally sovereign; but the  several States, at the same time, were regarded as forming one  nation, and, though divided into separate States, the people were  regarded as one people.  The Legislature of New York, as 216                                                          early as  1782, calls for an essential change In the Articles of  Confederation, as proved to be inadequate to secure the peace,  security, and prosperity of "the nation."  All the proceedings  that preceded and led to the call of the convention of 1781 were  based on the assumption that the people of the United States were  one people.  The States were called united, not confederated  States, even in the very Articles of Confederation themselves,  and officially the United States were called "the Union."  That  the united colonies by independence became united States, and  formed really one and only one people, was in the thought, the  belief, the instinct of the great mass of the people.  They acted  as they existed through State as they had previously acted  through colonial organization, for in throwing off the British  authority there was no other organization through which they  could act.  The States, or people of the States, severally sent  their delegates to the Congress of the United States, and these  delegates adopted the rule of voting in Congress by States, a  rule that might be revived without detriment to national unity.   Nothing was more natural, then, than that Congress, composed of  delegates elected or appointed by States, should draw up articles  of confederation 216                  rather than articles of union, in order, if for  no other reason, to conciliate the smaller States, and to prevent  their jealousy of the larger States such as Virginia,  Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.

Moreover, the Articles of Confederation were drawn up and adopted  during the transition from colonial dependence to national  independence.  Independence was declared in 1776, but it was not  a fact till l782, when the preliminary treaty acknowledging it  was signed at Paris.  Till then the United States were not an  independent nation; they were only a people struggling to become  an independent nation.  Prior to that preliminary treaty, neither  the Union nor the States severally were sovereign.  The articles  were agreed on in Congress in 1777, but they were not ratified by  all the States till May, 1781, and in 1782 the movement was  commenced in the Legislature of New York for their amendment.   Till the organization under the constitution ordained by the  people of the United States in l787, and which went into  operation in 1789, the United States had in reality only a  provisional government, and it was not till then that the  national government was definitively organized, and the line of  demarcation between the General Gov- 217                                    ernment and the particular  State governments was fixed.

The Confederation was an acknowledged failure, and was rejected  by the American people, precisely because it was not in harmony  with the unwritten or Providential constitution of the nation;  and it was not in harmony with that constitution precisely  because it recognized the States as severally sovereign, and  substituted confederation for union.  The failure of  confederation and the success of union are ample proofs of the  unity of the American nation.  The instinct of unity rejected  State sovereignty in 1787 as it did in 1861.  The first and the  last attempt to establish State sovereignty have failed, and the  failure vindicates the fact that the sovereignty is in the States  united, not in the States severally.




218 CHAPTER X

CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES


The constitution of the United States is twofold, written and  unwritten, the constitution of the people and the constitution of  the government.

The written constitution is simply a law ordained by the nation  or people instituting and organizing the government; the  unwritten constitution is the real or actual constitution of the  people as a state or sovereign community, and constituting them  such or such a state.  It is Providential, not made by the  nation, but born with it.  The written constitution is made and  ordained by the sovereign power, and presupposes that power as  already existing and constituted.

The unwritten or Providential constitution of the United States  is peculiar, and difficult to understand, because incapable of  being fully explained by analogies borrowed from any other state  historically known, or described 219                                  by political philosophers.  It  belongs	to the Graeco-Roman family, and is republican as	 distinguished from despotic constitutions, but it comes under the  head of neither monarchical nor aristocratic, neither democratic  nor mixed constitutions, and creates a state which is neither a  centralized state nor a confederacy.  The difficulty of  understanding it is augmented by the peculiar use under it of the  word state, which does not in the American system mean a  sovereign community or political society complete in itself, like  France, Spain, or Prussia, nor yet a political society  subordinate to another political society and dependent on it.   The American States are all sovereign States united, but,  disunited, are no States at all.  The rights and powers of the  States are not derived from the United States, nor the rights and  powers of the United States derived from the States.

The simple fact is, that the political or sovereign people of the  United States exists as united States, and only as united States.   The Union and the States are coeval, born together, and can exist  only together.  Separation is dissolution--the death of both.   The United States are a state, a single sovereign state; but this  single sovereign state consists in the union and solidarity of  States instead of individuals.  The 220                                     Union is in each of the  States, and each of the States is in the Union.

It is necessary to distinguish in the outset between the United  States and the government of the United States, or the so-called  Federal government, which the convention refused, contrary to its  first intention to call the national government.  That government  is not a supreme national government, representing all the powers  of the United States, but a limited government, restricted by its  constitution to certain specific relations and interests.  The  United States are anterior to that government, and the first  question to be settled relates to their internal and inherent  Providential constitution as one political people or sovereign  state.  The written constitution, in its preamble, professes to  be ordained by "We, the people of the United States."  Who are  this people?  How are they constituted, or what the mode and  conditions of their political existence?  Are they the people of  the States severally?  No; for they call themselves the people of  the United States.  Are they a national people, really existing  outside and independently of their organization into distinct and  mutually independent States?  No; for they define themselves to  be the people of the United States.  If they had considered 221 themselves existing as States only, they would have said "We, the  States," and if independently of State organization, they would  have said "We, the people," do ordain, &c.

The key to the mystery is precisely in this appellation United  States, which is not the name of the country, for its distinctive  name is America, but a name expressive of its political  organization.  In it there are no sovereign people without  States, and no States without union, or that are not united  States.  The term united is not part of a proper name, but is  simply an adjective qualifying States, and has its full and  proper sense.  Hence while the sovereignty is and must be in the  States, it is in the States united, not in the States severally,  precisely as we have found the sovereignty of the people is in  the people collectively or as society, not in the people  individually.  The life is in the body, not in the members,  though the body could not exist if it had no members; so the  sovereignty is in the Union, not in the States severally; but  there could be no sovereign union without the States, for there  is no union where there is nothing united.

This is not a theory of the constitution, but the constitutional  fact itself.  It is the simple historical fact that precedes the  law and con- 222            stitutes the law-making power.  The people of the  United States are one people, as has already been proved: they  were one people, as far as a people at all, prior to  independence, because under the same Common Law and subject to  the same sovereign, and have been so since, for as united States  they gained their independence and took their place among  sovereign nations, and as united States they have possessed and  still possess the government.  As their existence before  independence in distinct colonies did not prevent their unity,  so their existence since in distinct States does not hinder them  from being one people.  The States severally simply continue the  colonial organizations, and united they hold the sovereignty that  was originally in the mother country.  But if one people, they  are one people existing in distinct State organizations, as  before independence they were one people existing in distinct  colonial organizations.  This is the original, the unwritten, and  Providential constitution of the people of the United States.

This constitution is not conventional, for it existed before the  people met or could meet in convention.  They have not, as an  independent sovereign people, either established their union, or  distributed themselves into distinct and mu- 223                                            tually independent  States.  The union and the distribution, the unity and the  distinction, are both original in their constitution, and they  were born United States, as much and as truly so as the son of a  citizen is born a citizen, or as every one born at all is born a  member of society, the family, the tribe, or the nation.  The  Union and the States were born together, are inseparable in their  constitution, have lived and grown up together; no serious  attempt till the late secession movement has been made to  separate them; and the secession movement, to all persons who  knew not the real constitution of the United States, appeared  sure to succeed, and in fact would have succeeded if, as the  secessionists pretended, the Union had been only a confederacy,  and the States had been held together only by a conventional  compact, and not by a real and living bond of unity.  The popular  instinct of national unity, which seemed so weak, proved to be  strong enough to defeat the secession forces, to trample out the  confederacy, and maintain the unity of the nation and the  integrity of its domain.

The people can act only as they exist, as they are, not as they  are not.  Existing originally only as distributed in distinct and  mutually independent colonies, they could at first act only 224 through their colonial organizations, and afterward only through  their State organizations.  The colonial people met in  convention, in the person of representatives chosen by colonies,  and after independence in the person of representatives chosen by  States.  Not existing outside of the colonial or State  organizations, they could not act outside or independently of  them.  They chose their representatives or delegates by colonies  or States, and called at first their convention a Congress; but  by an instinct surer than their deliberate wisdom, they called it  not the Congress of the confederate, but of the United States,  asserting constitutional unity as well as constitutional  multiplicity.  It is true, in their first attempt to organize a  general government, they called the constitution they devised  Articles of Confederation, but only because they had not attained  to full consciousness of themselves; and that they really meant  union, not confederation, is evident from their adopting, as the  official style of the nation or new power, united, not  confederate States.

That the sovereignty vested in the States united, and was  represented in some sort by the Congress, is evident from the  fact that the several States, when they wished to adopt State  constitutions in place of colonial charters, felt not 225                                                       at liberty  to do so without asking and obtaining the permission of Congress,  as the elder Adams informs us in his Diary, kept at the time;  that is, they asked and obtained the equivalent of what has  since, in the case of organizing new States, been called an  "enabling act."  This proves that the States did not regard  themselves as sovereign States out of the Union, but as  completely sovereign only in it.  And this again proves that the  Articles of Confederation did not correspond to the real, living  constitution of the people.  Even then it was felt that the  organization and constitution of a State in the Union could be  regularly effected only by the permission of Congress; and no  Territory can, it is well known, regularly organize itself as a  State, and adopt a State constitution, without an enabling act by  Congress, or its equivalent.

New States, indeed, have been organized and been admitted into  the Union without an enabling act of Congress; but the case of  Kansas, if nothing else, proves that the proceeding is irregular,  illicit, invalid, and dangerous.  Congress, of course, can  condone the wrong and validate the act, but it were better that  the act should be validly done, and that there should be no wrong  to condone.  Territories have organized 226                                         as States, adopted State  constitutions, and instituted State governments under what has  been called "squatter sovereignty;" but such sovereignty has no  existence, because sovereignty is attached to the domain; and the  domain is in the United States.  It is the offspring of that  false view of popular sovereignty which places it in the people  personally or generically, irrespective of the domain, which  makes sovereignty a purely personal right, not a right fixed to  the soil, and is simply a return to the barbaric constitution of  power.  In all civilized nations, sovereignty is inseparable from  the state, and the state is inseparable from the domain.  The  will of the people, unless they are a state, is no law, has no  force, binds nobody, and justifies no act.

The regular process of forming and admitting new States explains  admirably the mutual relation of the Union and the several  States.  The people of a Territory belonging to the United States  or included in the public domain not yet erected into a State and  admitted into the Union, are subjects of the United States,  without any political rights whatever, and, though a part of the  population, are no part of the sovereign people of the United  States.  They become a part of that people, with political rights 227 and franchises, only when they are erected into a State, and  admitted into the Union as one of the United States.  They may  meet in convention, draw up and adopt a constitution declaring or  assuming them to be a State, elect State officers, senators, and  representatives in the State legislature, and representatives and  senators in Congress, but they are not yet a State, and are, as  before, under the Territorial government established by the  General Government.  It does not exist as a State till recognized  by Congress and admitted into the Union.  The existence of the  State, and the rights and powers of the people within the State,  depend on their being a State in the Union, or a State united.   Hence a State erected on the national domain, but itself outside  of the Union, is not an independent foreign State, but simply no  State at all, in any sense of the term.  As there is no union  outside of the States, so is there no State outside of the Union;  and to be a citizen either of a State or of the United States, it  is necessary to be a citizen of a State, and of a State in the  Union.  The inhabitants of Territories not yet erected into  States are subjects, not citizens--that is, not citizens with  political rights.  The sovereign people are not the people  outside of State organization, nor the people of the States  sever- 228      ally, but the distinct people of the several States united,  and therefore most appropriately called the people of the United  States.

This is the peculiarity of the American constitution and is  substantially the very peculiarity noted and dwelt upon by  Mr. Madison in his masterly letter to Edward Everett, published  in the "North American Review," October, 1830.

"I In order to understand the true character of the constitution  of the United States," says Mr. Madison, "the error, not  uncommon, must be avoided of viewing it through the medium either  of a consolidated government or of a confederated government,  whilst it is neither the one nor the other, but a mixture of  both.  And having, in no model, the similitudes and analogies  applicable to other systems of government, it must, more than any  other, be its own interpreter, according to its text and the  facts in the case.

"From these it will be seen that the characteristic peculiarities  of the constitution are: 1. The mode of its formation. 2. The  division of the supreme powers of government between the States  in their united capacity and the States in their individual  capacities.

"1. It was formed not by the governments of the component States,  as the Federal Govern- 229                      ment, for which it was substituted, was  formed; nor was it formed by a majority of the people of the  United States as a single community, in the manner of a  consolidated government.  It was formed by the States; that is,  by the people in each of the States, acting in their highest  sovereign capacity, and formed consequently by the same authority  which formed the State constitution.

"Being thus derived from the same source as the constitutions of  the States, it has within each State the same authority as the  constitution of the State, and is as much a constitution in the  strict sense of the term, within its prescribed sphere, as the  constitutions of the States are within their respective spheres;  but with this obvious and essential difference, that, being a  compact among the States in their highest capacity, and  constituting the people thereof one people for certain purposes,  it cannot be altered or annulled at the will of the States  individually, as the constitution of a State may be at its  individual will.

"2. And that it divides the supreme powers of government between  the government of the United States and the governments of the  individual States, is stamped on the face of the instrument; the  powers of war and of taxation, 230                                of commerce and treaties, and  other enumerated powers vested in the government of the United  States, are of high and sovereign a character as any of the  powers reserved to the State governments."

Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Webster, Chancellor Kent, Judge Story, and  nearly all the old Republicans, and even the old Federalists, on  the question as to what is the actual constitution of the United  States, took substantially the same view; but they all, as well  as Mr. Madison himself, speak of the written constitution, which  on their theory has and can have only a conventional value.   Mr. Madison evidently recognizes no constitution of the people  prior to the written constitution, from which the written  constitution, or the constitution of the government, derives all  its force and vitality.  The organization of the American people,  which he knew well--no man better,--and which he so justly  characterizes, he supposes to have been deliberately formed by  the people themselves, through the convention--not given them by  Providence as their original and inherent constitution.  But this  was merely the effect of the general doctrine which he had  adopted, in common with nearly all his contemporaries, of the  origin of the state in compact, and may be 231                                            eliminated from his  view of what the constitution actually is, without affecting that  view itself.

Mr. Madison lays great stress on the fact that though the  constitution of the Union was formed by the States, it was  formed, not by the governments, but by the people of the several  States; but this makes no essential difference, if the people are  the people of the States, and sovereign in their severalty, and  not in their union.  Had it been formed by the State governments  with the acquiescence of the people, it would have rested on as  high authority as if formed by the people of the State in  convention assembled.  The only difference is, that if the State  ratified it by the legislature, she could abrogate it by the  legislature; if in convention, she could abrogate it only in  convention.  Mr. Madison, following Mr. Jefferson, supposes the  constitution makes the people of the several States one people  for certain specific purposes, and leaves it to be supposed that  in regard to all other matters, or in all other relations, they  are sovereign; and hence he makes the government a mixture of a  consolidated government and a confederated government, but  neither the one nor the other exclusively.  Say the people of the  United States were one people in all 232                                      respects, and under a  government which is neither a consolidated nor a confederated  government, nor yet a mixture of the two, but a government in  which the powers of government are divided between a general  government and particular governments, each emanating from the  same source, and you will have the simple fact, and precisely  what Mr. Madison means, when is eliminated what is derived from  his theory of the origin of government in compact.  It is this  theory of the conventional origin of the constitution, and which  excludes the Providential or real constitution of the people,  that has misled him and so many other eminent statesmen and  constitutional lawyers.

The convention did not create the Union or unite the States, for  it was assembled by the authority of the United States who were  present in it.  The United States or Union existed before the  convention, as the convention itself affirms in declaring one of  its purposes to be "to provide for a more perfect union."  If  there had been no union, it could not and would not have spoken  of providing for a more perfect union, but would have stated its  purpose to be to create or form a union.  The convention did not  form the Union, nor in fact provide for a more perfect union; it  simply provided for the 233                         more perfect representation or expression  in the General government of the Union already existing.  The  convention, in common with the statesmen at the time, recognized  no unwritten or Providential constitution of a people, and  regarded the constitution of government as the constitution of  the state, and consequently sometimes put the state for the  government.  In intepreting its language, it is necessary to  distinguish between its act and its theory.  Its act is law, its  theory is not.  The convention met, among other things, to  organize a government which should more perfectly represent the  union of the States than did the government created by the  Articles of Confederation.

The convention, certainly, professes to grant or concede powers  to the United States, and to prohibit powers to the States; but  it simply puts the state for the government.  The powers of the  United States are, indeed, grants or trusts, but from God through  the law of nature, and are grants, trusts, or powers always  conceded to every nation or sovereign people.  But none of them  are grants from the convention.  The powers the convention grants  or concedes to the United States are powers granted or conceded  by the United States to the General government it assembled to  organize and establish,  234                         which, as it extends over the whole  population and territory of the Union, and, as the interests it  is charged with relate to all the States in common, or to the  people as a whole, is with no great impropriety called the  government of the United States, in contradistinction from the  State governments, which have each only a local jurisdiction.   But the more exact term is, for the one, the general government,  and for the others, particular governments, as having charge only  of the particular interests of the State; and the two together  constitute the government of the United States, or the complete  national government; for neither the General government nor the  State government is complete in itself.  The convention developed  a general government, and prescribed its powers, and fixed their  limits and extent, as well as the bounds of the powers of the  State or particular governments; but they are the United States  assembled in convention that do all this, and, therefore,  strictly speaking, no powers are conceded to the United States  that they did not previously possess.  The convention itself, in  the constitution it ordained, defines very clearly from whom the  General government holds its powers.  It holds them, as we I  have seen, from "We, the people 235                                  of the United States;" not we,  the people of the States severally, but of the States united.  If it had meant the States severally, it would have said, We, the  States; if it had recognized and meant the population of the  country irrespective of its organization into particular States,  it would have said simply, We, the people.  By saying "We, the  people of the United States," it placed the sovereign power where  it is, in the people of the States united.

The convention ordains that the powers not conceded to the  General government or prohibited to the particular governments,  "are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." But  the powers reserved to the States severally are reserved by order  of the United States, and the powers not so reserved are reserved  to the people.  What people?  The first thought is that they are  the people of the States severally; for the constitution  understands by people the state as distinguished from the state  government; but if this had been its meaning in this place, it  would have said, "are reserved to the States respectively, or to  the people" thereof.  As it does not say so, and does not define  the people it means, it is necessary to understand by them the  people called in the preamble "the people of the United States."   This is con- 236            firmed by the authority reserved to amend the  constitution, which certainly is not reserved to the States  severally, but necessarily to the power that ordains the  constitution--"We, the people of the United States."  No power  except that which ordains is or can be competent to amend a  constitution of government.  The particular mode prescribed by  the convention in which the constitution of the government may be  amended has no bearing on the present argument, because it is  prescribed by the States united, not severally, and the power to  amend is evidently reserved, not indeed to the General  government, but to the United States; for the ratification by any  State or Territory not in the Union counts for nothing.  The  States united, can, in the way prescribed, give more or less  power to the General government, and reserve more or less power  to the States individually.  The so-called reserved powers are  really reserved to the people of the United States, who can make  such disposition of them as seems to them good.

The conclusion, then, that the General government holds from the  States united, not from the States severally, is not invalidated  by the fact that its constitution was completed only by the  ratification of the States in their individ- 237                                            ual capacity.  The  ratification was made necessary by the will of the people in  convention assembled; but the convention was competent to  complete it and put it in force without that ratification, had it  so willed.  The general practice under the American system is for  the convention to submit the constitution it has agreed on to the  people, to be accepted or rejected by a plebiscitum; but such  submission, though it may be wise and prudent, is not necessary.   The convention is held to be the convention of the people, and to  be clothed with the full authority of the sovereign people, and  it is in this that it differs from the congress or the  legislature.  It is not a congress of delegates or ministers who  are obliged to act under instructions, to report their acts to  their respective sovereigns for approval or rejection; it is  itself sovereign, and may do whatever the people themselves can  do.  There is no necessity for it to appeal to a plebiscitum to  complete its acts.  That the convention, on the score of  prudence, is wise in doing so, nobody questions; but the  convention is always competent, if it chooses, to ordain the  constitution without appeal.  The power competent to ordain the  constitution is always competent to change, modify, or amend it.   That amend- 238           ments to the constitution of the government can be  adopted only by being proposed by a convention of all the States  in the Union, or by being proposed, by a two-thirds vote of both  houses of Congress, and ratified by three-fourths of the States,  is simply a conventional ordinance, which the convention can  change at its pleasure.  It proves nothing as it stands but the  will of the convention.

The term ratification itself, because the term commonly used in  reference to treaties between sovereign powers, has been seized  on, since sometimes used by the convention, to prove that the  constitution emanates from the States severally, and is a treaty  or compact between sovereign states, not an organic or  fundamental law ordained by a single sovereign will; but this  argument is inadmissible, because, as we have just seen, the  convention is competent to ordain the constitution without  submitting it for ratification, and because the convention uses  sometimes the word adopt instead of the word ratify.  That the  framers of the constitution held it to be a treaty, compact, or  agreement among sovereigns, there is no doubt, for they so held  in regard to all constitution of government; and there is just as  little doubt that they intended to constitute, and firmly  believed that 239               they were constituting a real government.   Mr. Madison's authority on this point is conclusive.  They  unquestionably regarded the States, prior to the ratification of  the constitution they proposed, as severally sovereign, as they  were declared to be by the old Articles of Confederation, but  they also believed that all individuals are sovereign prior to  the formation of civil society.  Yet very few, if any, of them  believed that they remained sovereign after the adoption of the  constitution; and we may attribute to their belief in the  conventional origin of all government,--the almost universal  belief of the time among political philosophers,--the little  account which they made of the historical facts that prove that  the people of the United States were always one people, and that  the States never existed as severally sovereign states.

The political philosophers of the present day do not generally  accept the theory held by our fathers, and it has been shown in  these pages to be unsound and incompatible with the essential  nature of government.  The statesmen of the eighteenth century  believed that the state is derived from the people individually,  and held that sovereignty is created by the people in convention.   The rights and powers of the state, they held, were made up of  the  240     rights held by individuals under the law of nature, and which  the individuals surrendered to civil society on its formation.   So they supposed that independent sovereign states might meet in  convention, mutually agree to surrender a portion of their  rights, organize their surrendered rights into a real government,  and leave the convention shorn, at least, of a portion of their  sovereignty.  This doctrine crops out everywhere in the writings  of the elder Adams, and is set forth with rare ability by  Mr. Webster, in his great speech in the Senate against the State  sovereignty doctrine of General Hayne and Mr. Calhoun, which won  for him the honorable title of Expounder of the Constitution--and  expound it he, no doubt, did in the sense of its framers.  He  boldly concedes that prior to the adoption of the constitution,  the people of the United States were severally sovereign states,  but by the constitution they were made one sovereign political  community or people, and that the States, though retaining  certain rights, have merged their several sovereignty in the  Union.

The subtle mind of Mr. Calhoun, who did not hold that a state can  originate in compact, proved to Mr. Webster that his theory could  not stand; that, if the States went into 241                                          the convention sovereign  States, they came out of it sovereign States; and that the  constitution they formed could from the nature of the case be  only a treaty, compact, or agreement between sovereigns.  It  could create an agency, but not a government.  The sovereign  States could only delegate the exercise of their sovereign  powers, not the sovereign powers themselves.  The States could  agree to exercise certain specific powers of sovereignty only in  common, but the force and vitality of the agreement depended on  the States, parties to the agreement retaining respectively their  sovereignty.  Hence, he maintained that sovereignty, after as  before the convention, vested in the States severally.  Hence  State sovereignty, and hence his doctrine that in all cases that  cannot come properly before the Supreme Court of the United  States for decision, each State is free to decide for itself, on  which he based the right of nullification, or the State veto of  acts of Congress whose constitutionality the State denies.   Mr. Calhoun was himself no secessionist, but he laid down the  premises from which secession is the logical deduction; and large  numbers of young men, among the most open, the most generous, and  the most patriotic in the country, adopted his premises, 242                                                          without  being aware of this fact any more than he himself was, and who  have been behind none in their loyalty to the Union, and in their  sacrifices to sustain it, in the late rebellion.

The formidable rebellion which is now happily suppressed, and  which attempted to justify itself by the doctrine of State  sovereignty, has thrown, in many minds, new light on the subject,  and led them to re-examine the historical facts in the case from  a different point of view, to see if Mr. Calhoun's theory is not  as unfounded as be had proved Mr. Webster's theory to be.  The  facts in the case really sustain neither, and both failed to see  it: Mr. Calhoun because be had purposes to accomplish which  demanded State sovereignty, and Mr. Webster because he examined  them in the distorting medium of the theory or understanding of  the statesmen of the eighteenth century.  The civil war has  vindicated the Union, and defeated the armed forces of the State  sovereignty men; but it has not refuted their doctrine, and as  far as it has had any effect, it has strengthened the tendency to  consolidation or centralism.

But the philosophy, the theory of government, the understanding  of the framers of the constitution, must be considered, if the  expres- 243       sion will be allowed, as obiter dicta, and be judged on  their merits.  What binds is the thing done, not the theory on  which it was done, or on which the actors explained their work  either to themselves or to others.  Their political philosophy,  or their political theory, may sometimes affect the phraseology  they adopt, but forms no rule for interpreting their work.  Their  work was inspired by and accords with the historical facts in the  case, and is authorized and explained by them.  The American  people were not made one people by the written constitution, as  Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Madison, Mr. Webster, and so many others  supposed, but were made so by the unwritten constitution, born  with and inherent in them.




244 CHAPTER XI.

THE CONSTITUTION--CONTINUED.


Providence, or God operating through historical facts,  constituted the American people one political or sovereign  people, existing and acting in particular communities,  organizations, called states.  This one people organized as  states, meet in convention, frame and ordain the constitution of  government, or institute a general government in place of the  Continental Congress; and the same people, in their respective  State organizations, meet in convention in each State, and frame  and ordain a particular government for the State individually,  which, in union with the General government, constitutes the  complete and supreme government within the States, as the General  government, in union with all the particular governments,  constitutes the complete and supreme government of the nation or  whole country.  This is clearly the view taken by Mr. Madison in  his letter to Mr. Everett,  245                            when freed from his theory of the  origin of government in compact.

The constitution of the people as one people, and the  distinction at the same time of this one people into particular  States, precedes the convention, and is the unwritten  constitution, the Providential constitution, of the American  people or civil society, as distinguished from the constitution  of the government, which, whether general or particular, is the  ordination of civil society itself.  The unwritten constitution  is the creation or constitution of the sovereign, and the  sovereign providentially constituted constitutes in turn the  government, which is not sovereign, but is clothed with just so  much and just so little authority as the sovereign wills or  ordains.

The sovereign in the republican order is the organic people, or  State, and is with us the United States, for with us the organic  people exist only as organized into States united, which in their  union form one compact and indissoluble whole.  That is to say,  the organic American people do not exist as a consolidated people  or state; they exist only as organized into distinct but  inseparable States.  Each State is a living member of the one  body, and derives its life from its union with the body, so that  the Amer- 246         ican state is one body with many members; and the  members, instead of being simply individuals, are States, or  individuals organized into States.  The body consists of many  members, and is one body, because the members are all members of  it, and members one of another.  It does not exist as separate  or distinct from the members, but exists in their solidarity or  membership one of another.  There is no sovereign people or  existence of the United States distinguishable from the people  or existence of the particular States united.  The people of the  United States, the state called the United States, are the  people of the particular States united.  The solidarity of the  members constitutes the unity of the body.  The difference  between this view and Mr. Madison's is, that while his view  supposes the solidarity to be conventional, originating and  existing in compact, or agreement, this supposes it to be real,  living, and prior to the convention, as much the work of  Providence as the existence in the human body of the living  solidarity of its members.  One law, one life, circulates  through all the members, constituting them a living organism,  binding them in living union, all to each and each to all.

Such is the sovereign people, and so far the original unwritten  constitution.  The sovereign,  247                               in order to live and act, must  have an organ through which be expresses his will.  This organ  under the American system, is primarily the Convention.  The  convention is the supreme political body, the concrete sovereign  authority, and exercises practically the whole sovereign power  of the people.  The convention persists always, although not in  permanent session.  It can at any time be convened by the  ordinary authority of the government, or, in its failure, by a  plebiscitum.

Next follows the Government created and constituted by the  convention.  The government is constituted in such manner, and  has such and only such powers, as the convention ordains.  The  government has, in the strict sense, no political authority  under the American system, which separates the government from  the convention.  All political questions proper, such as the  elective franchise, eligibility, the constitution of the several  departments of government, as the legislative, the judicial, and  the executive, changing, altering, or amending the constitution  of government, enlarging, or contracting its powers, in a word,  all those questions that arise on which it is necessary to take  the immediate orders of the sovereign, belong not to the  government, but to the convention; and where the will of the  sover- 248      eign is not sufficiently expressed in the constitution, a  new appeal to the convention is necessary, and may always be had.   The constitution of Great Britain makes no distinction between  the convention and the government.  Theoretically the  constitution of Great Britain is feudal, and there is, properly  speaking, no British state; there are only the estates, king,  lords, and commons, and these three estates constitute the  Parliament, which is held to be omnipotent; that is, has the  plenitude of political sovereignty.  The British Parliament,  composed of the three estates, possesses in itself all the  powers of the convention in the American constitution, and is at  once the convention and the government.  The imperial  constitution of France recognizes no convention, but clothes the  senate with certain political functions, which, in some  respects, subjects theoretically the sovereign to his creature.   The emperor confessedly holds his power by the grace of God and  the will of the nation, which is a clear acknowledgment that the  sovereignty vests in the French people as the French state; but  the imperial constitution, which is the constitution of the  government, not of the state, studies, while acknowledging the  sovereignty of the people, to render it nugatory, by  249                                                      transferring  it, under various subtle disguises, to the government, and  practically to the emperor as chief of the government.  The  senate, the council of state, the legislative body, and the  emperor, are all creatures of the French state, and have properly  no political functions, and to give them such functions is to  place the sovereign under his own subjects!  The real aim of the  imperial constitution is to secure despotic power under the  guise of republicanism.  It leaves and is intended to leave the  nation no way of practically asserting its sovereignty but by  either a revolution or a plebiscitum, and a plebiscitum is  permissible only where there is no regular government.

The British constitution is consistent with itself, but imposes  no restriction on the power of the government.  The French  imperial constitution is illogical, inconsistent with itself as  well as with the free action of the nation.  The American  constitution has all the advantages of both, and the  disadvantages of neither.  The convention is not the government  like the British Parliament, nor a creature of the state like  the French senate, but the sovereign state itself, in a  practical form.  By means of the convention the government is  restricted to its delegated powers, and these, if found in  practice either  250                 too great or too small, can be enlarged or  contracted in a regular, orderly way, without resorting to a  revolution or to a plebiscitum.  Whatever political grievances  there may be, there is always present the sovereign convention  competent to redress them.  The efficiency of power is thus  secured without danger to liberty, and freedom without danger to  power.  The recognition of the convention, the real political  sovereign of the country and its separation from and  independence of the ordinary government, is one of the most  striking features of the American constitution.

The next thing to be noted, after the convention, is the  constitution by the convention of the government.  This  constitution, as Mr. Madison well observes, divides the powers  conceded by the convention to government between the General  Government and the particular State governments.  Strictly  speaking, the government is one, and its powers only are divided  and exercised by two sets of agents or ministries.  This  division of the powers of government could never have been  established by the convention if the American people had not  been providentially constituted one people, existing and acting  through particular State organizations.  Here the unwritten  constitution, or the constitution  251                                   written in the people  themselves, rendered practicable and dictated the written  constitution, or constitution ordained by the convention and  engrossed on parchment.  It only expresses in the government the  fact which pre-existed in the national organization and life.

This division of the powers of government is peculiar to the  United States, and is an effective safeguard against both feudal  disintegration and Roman centralism.  Misled by their prejudices  and peculiar interests, a portion of the people of the United  States, pleading in their justification the theory of State  sovereignty, attempted disintegration, secession, and national  independence separate from that of the United States, but the  central force of the constitution was too strong for them to  succeed.  The unity of the nation was too strong to be  effectually broken.  No doubt the reaction against secession and  disintegration will strengthen the tendency to centralism, but  centralism can succeed no better than disintegration has  succeeded because the General government has no subsistentia, no  suppositum, to borrow a theological term, outside or independent  of the States.  The particular governments are stronger, if  there be any difference, to protect the States against  centralism than the General government is to protect the 252                                                          Union  against disintegration; and after swinging for a time too far  toward one extreme and then too far toward the other, the public  mind will recover its equilibrium, and the government move on in  its constitutional path.

Republican Rome attempted to guard against excessive centralism  by the tribunitial veto, or by the organization of a negative or  obstructive power.  Mr. Calhoun thought this admirable, and  wished to effect the same end here, where it is secured by  other, more effective, and less objectionable means, by a State  veto on the acts of Congress, by a dual executive, and by  substituting concurrent for numerical majorities.  Imperial Rome  gradually swept away the tribunitial veto, concentrated all  power in the hands of the emperor, became completely  centralized, and fell.  The British constitution seeks the same  end by substituting estates for the state, and establishing a  mixed government, in which monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy  temper, check, or balance each other; but practically the  commons estate has become supreme, and the nobility govern not  in the house of lords, and can really influence public affairs  only through the house of commons.  The principle of the British  constitution is not the division of the powers of government,  but the an- 253           tagonism of estates, or rather of interests, trusting  to the obstructive influence of that antagonism to preserve the  government from pure centralism.  Hence the study of the British  statesman is to manage diverse and antagonistic parties and  interests so as to gain the ability to act, which he can do only  by intrigue, cajolery, bribery in one form or another, and  corruption of every sort.  The British government cannot be  carried on by fair, honest, and honorable means, any more than  could the Roman under the antagonism created by the tribunitial  veto.  The French tried the English system of organized  antagonism in 1789, as a cure for the centralism introduced by  Richelieu and Louis XIV., and again under the Restoration and  Louis Philippe, and called it the system of constitutional  guarantees; but they could never manage it, and they have taken  refuge in unmitigated centralism under Napoleon III., who,  however well disposed, finds no means in the constitution of the  French nation of tempering it.  The English system, called the  constitutional, and sometimes the parliamentary system, will not  work in France, and indeed works really well nowhere.

The American system, sometimes called the Federal system, is not  founded on antagonism 254                       of classes, estates, or interests, and is  in no sense a system of checks and balances.  It needs and  tolerates no obstructive forces.  It does not pit section  against section, the States severally against the General  government, nor the General government against the State  governments, and nothing is more hurtful than the attempt to  explain it and work it on the principles of British  constitutionalism.  The convention created no antagonistic  powers; it simply divided the powers of government, and gave  neither to the General government nor to the State governments  all the powers of government, nor in any instance did it give to  the two governments jurisdiction in the same matters. Hence each  has its own sphere, in which it can move on without colliding  with that of the other.  Each is independent and complete in  relation to its own work, incomplete and dependent on the other  for the complete work of government.

The division of power is not between a NATIONAL government and  State governments, but between a GENERAL government and  particular governments.  The General government, inasmuch as it  extends to matters common to all the States, is usually called  the Government of the United States, and sometimes the Federal  255 government, to distinguish it from the particular or State  governments, but without strict propriety; for the government of  the United States, or the Federal government, means, in  strictness, both the General government and the particular  Governments, since neither is in itself the complete government  of the country.  The General government has authority within  each of the States, and each of the State governments has  authority in the Union.  The line between the Union and the  States severally, is not precisely the line between the General  government and the particular governments.  As, for instance,  the General government lays direct taxes on the people of the  States, and collects internal revenue within them; and the  citizens of a particular State, and none others, are electors of  President and Vice-President of the United States, and  representatives in the lower house of Congress, while senators  in Congress are elected by the State legislatures themselves.

The line that distinguishes the two governments is that which  distinguishes the general relations and interests from the  particular relations and interests of the people of the United  States.  These general relations and interests are placed under  the General government, which, because its jurisdiction is  coextensive with the 256                      Union, is called the Government of the  United States; the particular relations and interests are placed  under particular governments, which, because their jurisdiction  is only coextensive, with the States respectively, are called  State governments.  The General government governs supremely all  the people of the United States and Territories belonging to the  Union, in all their general relations and interests, or  relations and interests common alike to them all; the particular  or State government governs supremely the people of a particular  State, as Massachusetts, New York, or New Jersey, in all that  pertains to their particular or private rights, relations, and  interests.  The powers of each are equally sovereign, and  neither are derived from the other.  The State governments are  not subordinate to the General government, nor the General  government to the State governments.  They are co-ordinate  governments, each standing on the same level, and deriving its  powers from the same sovereign authority.  In their respective  spheres neither yields to the other.  In relation to the matters  within its jurisdiction, each government is independent and  supreme in regard of the other, and subject only to the  convention.

257 The powers of the General government are the power--

To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay  the debts and provide for the general welfare of the United  States; to borrow money on the credit of the United States; to  regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several  States, and with the Indian tribes; to establish a uniform rule  of naturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of  bankruptcies throughout the United States; to coin money and  regulate the value thereof, and fix the standard of weights and  measures; to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the  securities and current coin of the United States; to establish  post-offices and post-roads; to promote the progress of science  and of the useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors  and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings  and discoveries; to define and punish piracies and felonies  committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of  nations; to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal,  and make rules concerning captures on land and water; to raise  and support armies; to provide and maintain a navy; to make  rules for the government of the land and naval forces; to  provide for calling forth the militia to  258                                          execute the laws of the  Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions; to provide  for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and of  governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of  the United States; to exercise exclusive legislation in all  cases whatsoever over such district, not exceeding ten miles  square, as may by cession of particular States and the  acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the  United States, and to exercise a like authority over all places  purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in  which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines,  arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings; and to make  all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into  execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by  this constitution in the government of the United States, or in  any department or office thereof.

In addition to these, the General government is clothed with the  treaty-making power, and the whole charge of the foreign  relations of the country; with power to admit new States into  the Union; to dispose of and make all needful rules and  regulations concerning the territory and all other property  belonging to the United States; to declare, with certain  restrictions, the punishment 259                              of treason, the constitution itself  defining what is treason against the United States; and to  propose, or to call, on the application of the legislatures of  two-thirds of all the states, a convention for proposing  amendments to this constitution; and is vested with supreme  judicial power, original or appellate, in all cases of law and  equity arising under this constitution, the laws of the United  States, and treaties made or to be made under their authority,  in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and  consuls, in all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, in  all controversies to which the United States shall be a party,  all controversies between two or more States, between a State  and citizens of another State, between citizens of different  States, between citizens of the same State claiming lands under  grants of different States, and between a State or the citizens  thereof and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.

These, with what is incidental to them, and what is necessary  and proper to carry them into effect, are all the positive  powers with which the convention vests the General government,  or government of the United States, as distinguished from the  governments of the particular States; and these, with the  exception of what relates to the district in which it has 260                                                           its  seat, and places of forts, magazines, &c., are of a general  nature, and restricted to the common relations and interests of  the people, or at least to interests and relations which extend  beyond the limits of a particular State.  They are all powers  that regard matters which extend beyond not only the individual  citizen, but the individual State, and affect alike the  relations and interests of all the States, or matters which  cannot be disposed of by a State government without the exercise  of extra-territorial jurisdiction.  They give the government no  jurisdiction of questions which affect individuals or citizens  only in their private and domestic relations which lie wholly  within a particular State.  The General government does not  legislate concerning private rights, whether of persons or  things, the tenure of real estate, marriage, dower, inheritance,  wills, the transferrence or transmission of property, real or  personal; it can charter no private corporations, out of the  District of Columbia, for business, literary, scientific, or  eleemosynary purposes, establish no schools, found no colleges  or universities, and promote science and the useful arts only by  securing to authors and inventors for a time the exclusive right  to their writings and discoveries.  The United States Bank was  man- 261    ifestly unconstitutional, as probably are the present  so-called national banks.  The United States Bank was a private  or particular corporation, and the present national banks are  only corporations of the same sort, though organized under a  general law.  The pretence that they are established to supply a  national currency, does not save their constitutionality, for  the convention has not given the General government the power  nor imposed on it the duty of furnishing a national currency.   To coin money, and regulate the value thereof, is something very  different from authorizing private companies to issue bank  notes, on the basis of the public stocks held as private  property, or even on what is called a specie basis.  To claim  the power under the general welfare clause would be a simple  mockery of good sense.  It is no more for the general welfare  than any other successful private business.  The private welfare  of each is, no doubt, for the welfare of all, but not therefore  is it the "general welfare," for what is private, particular in  its nature, is not and cannot be general.  To understand by  general welfare that which is for the individual welfare of all  or the greater number, would be to claim for the General  government all the powers of government, and 262                                              to deny that very  division of powers which is the crowning merit of the American  system.  The general welfare, by the very force of the words  themselves, means the common as distinguished from the private  or individual welfare.  The system of national banks may or may  not be a good and desirable system, but it is difficult to  understand the constitutional power of the General government to  establish it.

On the ground that its powers are general, not particular, the  General government has no power to lay a protective tariff.  It  can lay a tariff for revenue, not for protection of home  manufactures or home industry; for the interests fostered, even  though indirectly advantageous to the whole people, are in their  nature private or particular, not general interests, and chiefly  interests of private corporations and capitalists.  Their  incidental or even consequential effects do not change their  direct and essential nature.  So with domestic slavery.  Slavery  comes under the head of private rights, whether regarded on the  side of the master or on the side of the slave.  The right of a  citizen to hold a slave, if a right at all, is the private right  of property, and the right of the slave to his freedom is a  private and personal right, and neither is placed under the  safeguard of the General government, 263                                      which has nowhere, unless  in the District of Columbia and the places over which it has  exclusive legislative power in all cases whatsoever, either the  right to establish it or to abolish it, except perhaps under the  war power, as a military necessity, an indemnity for the past,  or a security for the future.

This applies to what are called Territories as well as to the  States.  The right of the government to govern the Territories  in regard to private and particular rights and interests, is  derived from no express grant of power, and is held only ex  necessitate--the United States owning the domain, and there  being no other authority competent to govern them.  But, as in  the case of all powers held ex necessitate, the power is  restricted to the absolute necessity in the case.  What are  called Territorial governments, to distinguish them from the  State governments, are only provisional governments, and can  touch private rights and interests no further than is necessary  to preserve order and prepare the way for the organization and  installation of a regular State government.  Till then the law  governing private rights is the law that was in force, if any  such there was, when the territory became by purchase, by 264 conquest, or by treaty, attached to the domain of the United  States.

Hence the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the ordinance  of l787, prohibiting slavery in what was called the territory of  the Northwest, and the so-called Missouri Compromise,  prohibiting slavery north of the parallel 36' 30'.  The Wilmot  proviso was for the same reason unconstitutional.  The General  government never had and has not any power to exclude slavery  from the Territories, any more than to abolish it in the States.   But slavery being a local institution, sustained neither by the  law of nature nor the law of nations, no citizen migrating from  a slave State could carry his slaves with him, and hold them as  slaves in the Territory.  Rights enacted by local law are rights  only in that locality, and slaves carried by their masters into  a slave State even, are free, unless the State into which they  are carried enacts to the contrary.  The only persons that could  be held as slaves in a Territory would be those who were slaves  or the children of those who were slaves in the Territory when  it passed to the United States.  The whole controversy on,  slavery in the Territories, and which culminated in the civil  war, was wholly unnecessary, and never could have  265                                                   occurred had  the constitution been properly understood and adhered to by both  sides.  True, Congress could not exclude slavery from the  Territory, but neither could citizens migrating to them hold  slaves in them; and so really slavery was virtually excluded,  for the inhabitants in nearly all of them, not emigrants from  the States after the cession to the United States, were too few  to be counted.

The General government has power to establish a uniform rule of  naturalization, to which all the States must conform, and it was  very proper that it should have this power, so as to prevent one  State from gaining by its naturalization laws an undue advantage  over another; but the General government has itself no power to  naturalize a single foreigner, or in any case to say who shall  or who shall not be citizens, either of a State or of the United  States, or to declare who may or may not be electors even of its  own officers.  The convention ordains that members of the house  of representatives shall be chosen by electors who have the  qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous  branch of the State legislature, but the State determines these  qualifications, and who do or do not possess them; that the  senators shall be chosen by the State legislatures, and  266                                                    that the  electors of President and Vice-President shall be appointed in  such manner as the respective State legislatures may direct.  The  whole question of citizenship, what shall or shall not be the  qualifications of electors, who shall or shall not be freemen, is  reserved to the, States, as coming under the head of personal or  private rights and franchises.  In practice, the exact line of  demarcation may not always have been strictly observed either by  the General government or by the State governments; but a  careful study of the constitution cannot fail to show that the  division of powers is the division or distinction between the  public and general relations and interests, rights and duties of  the people, and their private and particular relations and  interests, rights and duties.  As these two classes of relations  and interests, rights and duties, though distinguishable, are  really inseparable in nature, it follows that the two governments  are essential to the existence of a complete government, or to  the existence of a real government in its plenitude and  integrity.  Left to either alone, the people would have only an  incomplete, an initial, or inchoate government.  The General  government is the complement of the State governments, and the  267 State governments are the complement of the General government.

The consideration of the powers denied by the convention to the  General government and to the State governments respectively,  will lead to the same conclusion.  To the General government is  denied expressly or by necessary implication all jurisdiction in  matters of private rights and interests, and to the State  government is denied all jurisdiction in right, or interests  which extend, as has been said, beyond the boundaries of the  State.  "No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or  confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money,  emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and silver coin a  tender in the payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex  post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or  grant any title of nobility.  No State shall, without the  consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or  exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing  its inspection laws and the net produce of all duties and  imposts laid by any State on imports and exports shall be for the  use of the treasury of the United States, and all such laws  shall be subject to the revision and control of Congress.  No  State shall, with- 268                  out the consent of Congress, lay any duty of  tonnage, keep troops or ships-of-war in time of peace, enter into  any agreement or compact with another State or with a foreign  power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such  imminent danger as will not admit of delay."

The powers denied to the States in some matters which are rather  private and particular, such as bills of attainder, ex post  facto laws, laws impairing the obligation of contracts, granting  titles of nobility, are denied equally to the General government.   There is evidently a profound logic in the constitution, and  there is not a single provision in it that is arbitrary, or  anomalous, or that does not harmonize dialectically with the  whole, and with the real constitution of the American people.  At  first sight the reservation to the State of the appointment of  the officers of the militia might seem an anomaly; but as the  whole subject of internal police belongs to the State, it should  have some military force at its command.  The subject of  bankruptcies, also, might seem to be more properly within the  province of the State, and so it would be if commerce between the  several States had not been placed under Congress, or if trade  were confined to the citizens 269                               of the State and within its  boundaries; but as such is not the case, it was necessary to  place it under the General government, in order that laws on the  subject might be uniform throughout the Union, and that the  citizens of all the States, and foreigners trading with them,  should be placed on an equal footing, and have the same remedies.   The subject follows naturally in the train of commerce, for  bankruptcies, as understood at the time, were confined to the  mercantile class, bankers, and brokers; and since the regulation  of commerce, foreign and inter-state, was to be placed under the  sole charge of the General government, it was necessary that  bankruptcy should be included.  The subject of patents is placed  under the General government, though the patent is a private  right, because it was the will of the convention that the patent  should be good in all the States, as affording more encouragement  to science and the useful arts than if good only within a single  State, or if the power were left to each State to recognize or  not patents granted by another.  The right created, though  private in its nature, is Yet general or common to all the States  in its enjoyment or exercise.

The division of the powers of government between a General  government and particular 270                           governments, rendered possible and  practicable by the original constitution of the people  themselves, as one people existing and acting through State  organizations, is the American method of guarding against the  undue centralism to which Roman imperialism inevitably tends;  and it is far simpler and more effective than any of the  European systems of mixed governments, which seek their end by  organizing an antagonism of interests or classes.  The American  method demands no such antagonism, no neutralizing of one social  force by another, but avails itself of all the forces of society,  organizes them dialectically, not antagonistically, and thus  protects with, equal efficiency both public authority and  private rights.  The General government can never oppress the  people as individuals, or abridge their private rights or  personal freedom and independence, because these are not within  its jurisdiction, but are placed in charge, within each State,  of the State government, which, within its sphere, governs as  supremely as the General government: the State governments  cannot weaken the public authority of the nation or oppress the  people in their general rights and interests, for these are  withdrawn from State jurisdiction, and placed under charge of a  Gen- 271 eral government, which, in its sphere, governs as supremely as  the State government.  There is no resort to a system of checks  and balances; there is no restraint on power, and no systematic  distrust of power, but simply a division of powers between two  co-ordinate governments, distinct but inseparable, moving in  distinct spheres, but in the same direction, or to a common end.   The system is no invention of man, is no creation of the  convention, but is given us by Providence in the living  constitution of the American people.  The merit of the statesmen  of 1787 is that they did not destroy or deface the work of  Providence, but accepted it, and organized the government in  harmony with the real orders the real elements given them.  They  suffered themselves in all their positive substantial work to be  governed by reality, not by theories and speculations.  In this  they proved themselves statesmen, and their work survives; and  the republic, laugh as sciolists may, is, for the present and  future, the model republic--as much so as was Rome in her day;  and it is not simply national pride nor American self-conceit  that pronounces its establishment the beginning of a new and  more advanced order of civilization; such is really the fact.

The only apparently weak point in the sys- 272                                          tem is in the  particular States themselves.  Feudalism protected the feudal  aristocracy effectively for a time against both the king and the  people, but left the king and the, people without protection  against the aristocracy, and hence it fell.  It was not adequate  to the wants of civil society, did not harmonize all social  elements, and protect all social and individual rights and  interests, and therefore could not but fail.  The General  government takes care of public authority and rights; the State  protects private rights and personal freedom as against the  General government: but what protects the citizens in their  private rights, their personal freedom and independence, against  the particular State government?  Universal suffrage, answers  the democrat.  Armed with the ballot, more powerful than the  sword, each citizen is able to protect himself.  But this is  theory, not reality.  If it were true, the division of the  powers of government between two co-ordinate, governments would  be of no practical importance.  Experience does not sustain the  theory, and the power of the ballot to protect the individual  may be rendered ineffective by the tyranny of party.  Experience  proves that the ballot is far less effective in securing the  freedom and independence of the individual citizen than is 273 commonly pretended.  The ballot of an isolated individual counts  for nothing.  The individual, though armed with the ballot, is  as powerless, if he stands alone, as if he had it not.  To  render it of any avail he must associate himself with a party,  and look for his success in the success of his party; and to  secure the success of his party, he must give up to it his own  private convictions and free will.  In practice, individuals are  nothing individually, and parties are every thing.  Even the  suppression of the late rebellion, and the support of the  Administration in doing it, was made a party question, and the  government found the leaders of the party opposed to the  Republican party an obstacle hardly less difficult to surmount  than the chiefs of the armies of the so-called Confederate  States.

Parties are formed, one hardly knows how, and controlled, no one  knows by whom; but usually by demagogues, men who have some  private or personal purposes, for which they wish, through party  to use the government.  Parties have no conscience, no  responsibility, and their very reason of being is, the  usurpation and concentration of power.  The real practical  tendency of universal suffrage is to democratic, instead of an  imperial, centralism. 274                        What is to guard against this centralism?   Not universal suffrage, for that tends to create it;, and if the  government is left to it, the government becomes practically the  will of an ever shifting and irresponsible majority.  Is the  remedy in written or paper constitutions?  Party can break  through them, and by making the judges elective by party, for  short terms, and re-eligible, can do so with impunity.  In  several of the States, the dominant majority have gained the  power to govern at will, without any let or hindrance.  Besides,  constitutions can be altered, and have been altered, very nearly  at the will of the majority.  No mere paper constitutions are  any protection against the usurpations of party, for party will  always grasp all the power it can.

Yet the evil is not so great as it seems, for in most of the  States the principle of division of powers is carried into the  bosom of the State itself; in some States further than in  others, but in all it obtains to some extent.  In what are  called the New England States, the best governed portion of the  Union, each town is a corporation, having important powers and  the charge of all purely local matters--chooses its own  officers, manages its own finances, takes charge of its own  poor, of its own roads 275                        and bridges, and of the education of its  own children.  Between these corporations and the State  government are the counties, that take charge of another class  of interests, more general than those under the charge of the  town, but less general than those of the State.  In the great  central and Northwestern States the same system obtains, though  less completely carried out.  In the Southern and Southwestern  States, the town corporations hardly exist, and the rights and  interests of the poorer classes of persons have been less well  protected in them than in the Northern and Eastern States.  But  with the abolition of slavery, and the lessening of the  influence of the wealthy slaveholding class, with the return of  peace and the revival of agricultural, industrial, and  commercial prosperity, the New England system, in its main  features, is pretty sure to be gradually introduced, or  developed, and the division of powers in the State to be as  effectively and as systematically carried out as it is between  the General government and the particular or State governments.   So, though universal suffrage, good as far as it goes, is not  alone sufficient, the division of powers affords with it a not  inadequate protection.

No government, whose workings are intrusted 276                                             to men, ever is or  can be practically perfect--secure all good, and guard against  all evil.  In all human governments there will be defects and  abuses, and he is no wise man who expects perfection from  imperfection.  But the American constitution, taken as a whole,  and in all its parts, is the least imperfect that has ever  existed, and under it individual rights, personal freedom and  independence, as well as public authority or society, are better  protected than under any other; and as the few barbaric elements  retained from the feudal ages are eliminated, the standard of  education elevated, and the whole population Americanized,  moulded by and to the American system, it will be found to  effect all the good, with as little of the evil, as can be  reasonably expected from any possible civil government or  political constitution of society.




277 CHAPTER XI.

SECESSION.


The doctrine that a State has a right to secede and carry with it  its population and domain, has been effectually put down, and the  unity and integrity of the United States as a sovereign nation  have been effectively asserted on the battle-field; but the  secessionists, though disposed to submit to superior force, and  demean themselves henceforth as loyal citizens, most likely hold  as firmly to the doctrine as before finding themselves unable to  reduce it to practice, and the Union victory will remain  incomplete till they are convinced in their understandings that  the Union has the better reason as well as the superior military  resources.  The nation has conquered their bodies, but it is  hardly less important for our statesmen to conquer their minds  and win their hearts.

The right of secession is not claimed as a revolutionary right,  or even as a conventional right.  The secessionists disclaim  revolutionary 278               principles, and hold that the right of secession is  anterior to the convention, a right which the convention could  neither give, nor take away, because inherent in the very  conception of a sovereign State.  Secession is simply the repeal  by the State of the act of accession to the Union; and as that  act was a free, voluntary act of the State, she must always be  free to repeal it.  The Union is a copartnership; a State in the  Union is simply a member of the firm, and has the right to  withdraw when it judges it for its interest to do so.  There is  no power in a firm to compel a copartner to remain a member any  longer than be pleases.  He is undoubtedly holden for the  obligations contracted by the firm while he remains a member; but  for none contracted after he has withdrawn and given due notice  thereof.

So of a sovereign State in the Union.  The Union itself, apart  from the sovereign States that compose it, is a mere abstraction,  a nullity, and binds nobody.  All its substance and vitality are  in the agreement by which the States constitute themselves a firm  or copartnership, for certain specific purposes, and for which  they open an office and establish an agency under express  instructions for the management of the general affairs of the  firm.  The State is held 279                          jointly and severally for all the legal  obligations of the Union, contracted while she is in it but no  further; and is free to withdraw when she pleases, precisely as  an individual may withdraw from an ordinary business firm. The  remaining copartners have no right of compulsion or coercion  against the seceding member, for he, saving the obligations  already contracted, is as free to withdraw as they are to remain.

The population is fixed to the domain and goes with it; the  domain is attached to the State, and secedes in the secession of  the State.  Secession, then, carries the entire State government,  people, and domain out of the Union, and restores ipso facto the  State to its original position of a sovereign State, foreign to  the United States.  Being an independent sovereign State, she may  enter into a new confederacy, form a new copartnership, or merge  herself in some other foreign state, as she judges proper or  finds opportunity.  The States that seceded formed among  themselves a new confederacy, more to their mind than the one  formed in 1787, as they had a perfect right to do, and in the war  just ended they were not rebels nor revolutionists, but a people  fighting for the right of self-government, loyal citizens and  true patriots de- 280                 fending the independence and inviolability of  their country against foreign invaders.  They are to be honored  for their loyalty and patriotism, and not branded as rebels and  punished as traitors.

This is the secession argument, which rests on no assumption of  revolutionary principles or abstract rights of man, and on no  allegation of real or imaginary wrongs received from the Union,  but simply on the original and inherent rights of the several  States as independent sovereign States.  The argument is  conclusive, and the defence complete, if the Union is only a firm  or copartnership, and the sovereignty vests in the States  severally.  The refutation of the secessionists is in the facts  adduced that disprove the theory of State sovereignty, and prove  that the sovereignty vests not in the States severally, but in  the States united, or that the Union is sovereign, and not the  States individually.  The Union is not a firm, a copartnership,  nor an artificial or conventional union, but a real, living,  constitutional union, founded in the original and indissoluble  unity of the American people, as one sovereign people.  There is,  indeed, no such people, if we abstract the States, but there are  no States if we abstract this sovereign people or the Union.   There is 281          no Union without the States, and there are no States  without the Union.  The people are born States, and the States  are born United States.  The Union and the States are  simultaneous, born together, and enter alike into the original  and essential constitution of the American state.  This the facts  and reasonings adduced fully establish.

But this one sovereign people that exists only as organized into  States, does not necessarily include the whole population or  territory included within the jurisdiction of the United States.   It is restricted to the people and territory or domain organized  into States in the Union, as in ancient Rome the ruling people  were restricted to the tenants of the sacred territory, which had  been surveyed, and its boundaries marked by the god Terminus, and  which by no means included all the territory held by the city,  and of which she was both the private proprietor and the public  sovereign.  The city had vast possessions acquired by  confiscation, by purchase, by treaty, or by conquest, and in  reference to which her celebrated agrarian laws were enacted, and  which have their counterpart in our homestead and kindred laws.   In this class of territory, of which the city was the private  owner, was the territory of all the 282                                     Roman provinces, which was  held to be only leased to its occupants, who were often  dispossessed, and their lands given as a recompense by the consul  or imperator to his disbanded legionaries.  The provincials were  subjects of Rome, but formed no part of the Roman people, and had  no share in the political power of the state, till at a late  period the privileges of Roman citizens were extended to them,  and the Roman people became coextensive with the Roman empire.   So the United States have held and still hold large territorial  possessions, acquired by the acknowledgment of their independence  by Great Britain, the former sovereign, the cession of particular  states, and purchase from France, Spain, and Mexico.  Till  erected into States and admitted into the Union, this territory,  with its population, though subject to the United States, makes  no part of the political or sovereign territory and people of the  United States.  It is under the Union, not in it, as is indicated  by the phrase admitting into the Union--a legal phrase, since the  constitution ordains that "new States may be admitted by the  Congress into this Union."

There can be no secession that separates a State from the  national domain, and withdraws it from the territorial  sovereignty or jurisdic- 283                        tion of the United States; yet what  hinders a State from going out of the Union in the sense that it  comes into it, and thus ceasing to belong to the political people  of the United States?

If the view of the constitution taken in the preceding chapters  be correct, and certainly no facts tend to disprove it, the  accession of a Territory as a State in the Union is a free act of  the territorial people.  The Territory cannot organize and apply  for admission as a State, without what is called an "enabling act"  of Congress or its equivalent; but that act is permissive, not  mandatory, and nothing obliges the Territory to organize under it  and apply for admission.  It may do so or not, as it chooses.   What, then, hinders the State once in the Union from going out or  returning to its former condition of territory subject to the  Union?  The original States did not need to come in under an  enabling act, for they were born States in the Union, and were  never territory outside of the Union and subject to it.  But they  and the new States, adopted or naturalized States, once in the  Union, stand on a footing of perfect equality, and the original  States are no more and no less bound than they to remain States  in the Union.  The ratification of the constitution by the  original States was a 284                       free act, as much so as the accession of a  new State formed from territory subject to the Union is a free  act, and a free act is an act which one is free to do or not to  do, as he pleases.  What a State is free to do or not to do, it  is free to undo, if it chooses.  There is nothing in either the  State constitution or in that of the United States that forbids  it.

This is denied.  The population and domain are inseparable in the  State; and if the State could take itself out of the Union, it  would take them out, and be ipso facto a sovereign State foreign  to the Union.  It would take the domain and the population out of  the Union, it is conceded and even maintained, but not therefore  would it take them out of the jurisdiction of the Union, or would  they exist as a State foreign to the Union; for population and  territory may coexist, as Dacota, Colorado, or New Mexico, out of  the Union, and yet be subject to the Union, or within the  jurisdiction of the United States.

But the Union is formed by the surrender by each of the States of  its individual sovereignty, and each State by its admission into  the Union surrenders its individual sovereignty, or binds itself  by a constitutional compact to merge its individual sovereignty  in that of 285            the whole.  It then cannot cease to be a State in the  Union without breach of contract.  Having surrendered its  sovereignty to the Union, or bound itself by the constitution to  exercise its original sovereignty only as one of the United States,  it can unmake itself of its state character, only by consent of  the United States, or by a successful revolution.  It is by  virtue of this fact that secession is rebellion against the  United States, and that the General government, as representing  the Union, has the right and the duty to suppress it by all the  forces at its command.

There can be no rebellion where there is no allegiance.  The  States in the Union cannot owe allegiance to the Union, for they  are it, and for any one to go out of it is no more an act of  rebellion than it is for a king to abdicate his throne.  The  Union is not formed by the surrender to it by the several States  of their respective individual sovereignty.  Such surrender  could, as we have seen, form only an alliance, or a  confederation, not one sovereign people; and from an alliance, or  confederation, the ally or confederate has, saving its faith, the  inherent right to secede.  The argument assumes that the States  were originally each in its individuality a sovereign state, but by  the con- 286        vention which framed the constitution, each surrendered  its sovereignty to the whole, and thus several sovereign states  became one sovereign political people, governing in general  matters through the General government, and in particular matters  through particular or State governments.  This is Mr. Madison's  theory, and also Mr. Webster's; but it has been refuted in the  refutation of the theory that makes government originate in  compact.  A sovereign state can, undoubtedly, surrender its  sovereignty, but can surrender it only to something or somebody  that really exists; for to Surrender to no one or to nothing is,  as has been shown, the same thing as not to surrender at all; and  the Union, being formed only by the surrender, is nothing prior  to it, or till after it is made, and therefore can be no  recipient of the surrender.

Besides, the theory is the reverse of the fact.  The State does  not surrender or part with its sovereignty by coming into the  Union, but acquires by it all the rights it holds as a State.   Between the original States and the new States there is a  difference of mode by which they become States in the Union, but  none in their powers, or the tenure by which they hold them.  The  process by which new States are 287                                 actually formed and admitted into  the Union, discloses at once what it is that is gained or lost by  admission.  The domain and population, before the organization of  the Territory into one of the United States, are subject to the  United States, inseparably attached to the domain of the Union,  and under its sovereignty.  The Territory so remains, organized  or unorganized, under a Territorial Government created by  Congress.  Congress, by an enabling act, permits it to organize  as a State, to call a convention to form a State constitution, to  elect under it, in such way as the convention ordains, State  officers, a State legislature, and, in the way prescribed by the  Constitution of the United States, senators and representatives  in Congress.  Here is a complete organization as a State, yet,  though called a State, it is no State at all, and is simply  territory, without a single particle of political power.  To be a  State it must be recognized and admitted by Congress as a State  in the Union, and when so recognized and admitted it possesses,  in union with the other United States, supreme political  sovereignty, jointly in all general matters, and individually in  all private and particular matters.

The Territory gives up no sovereign powers 288                                            by coming into the  Union, for before it came into the Union it had no sovereignty,  no political rights at all.  All the rights and powers it holds  are held by the simple fact that it has become a State in the  Union.  This is as true of the original States as of the new  States; for it has been shown in the chapter on The United States,  that the original British sovereignty under which the colonies  were organized and existed passed, on the fact of independence,  to the States United, and not to the States severally.  Hence if  nine States had ratified the constitution, and the other four had  stood out, and refused to do it, which was within their  competency, they would not have been independent sovereign  States, outside of the Union, but Territories under the Union.

Texas forms the only exception to the rule that the States have  never been independent of the Union.  All the other new States  have been formed from territory subject to the Union.  This is  true of all the States formed out of the Territory of the  Northwest, and out of the domain ceded by France, Spain, and  Mexico to the United States.  All these cessions were held by the  United States as territory immediately subject to the Union,  before being erected into States; and by far the larger 289                                                         part is  so held even yet.  But Texas was an independent foreign state,  and was annexed as a State without having been first subjected as  territory to the United States.  It of course lost by annexation  its separate sovereignty.  But this annexation was held by many  to be unconstitutional; it was made when the State sovereignty  theory had gained possession of the Government, and was annexed  as a State instead of being admitted as a State formed from  territory belonging to the United States, for the very purpose of  committing the nation to that theory.  Its annexation was the  prologue, as the Mexican war was the first act in the secession  drama, and as the epilogue is the suppression of the rebellion on  Texan soil.  Texas is an exceptional case, and forms no  precedent, and cannot be adduced as invalidating the general  rule.  Omitting Texas, the simple fact is, the States acquire all  their sovereign powers by being States in the Union, instead of  losing or surrendering them.

Our American statesmen have overlooked or not duly weighed the  facts in the case, because, holding the origin of government in  compact, they felt no need of looking back of the constitution to  find the basis of that unity of the American people which they  assert.  Neither Mr. Madi- 190                          son nor Mr. Webster felt any difficulty  in asserting it as created by the convention of 1787, or in  conceding the sovereignty of the States prior to the Union, and  denying its existence after the ratification of the constitution.   If it were not that they held that the State originates in  convention or the social compact, there would be unpardonable  presumption on the part of the present writer in venturing to  hazard an assertion contrary to theirs.  But, if their theory was  unsound, their practical doctrine was not; for they maintained  that the American people are one sovereign people, and Mr. Quincy  Adams, an authority inferior to neither, maintained that they  were always one people, and that the States hold from the Union,  not the Union from the States.  The States without the Union  cease to exist as political communities: the Union without the  States ceases to be a Union, and becomes a vast centralized and  consolidated state, ready to lapse from a civilized into a  barbaric, from a republican to a despotic nation.

The State, under the American system, as distinguished from  Territory, is not in the domain and population fixed to it, nor  yet in its exterior organization, but solely in the political  powers, rights, and franchises which it 291                                         holds from the United  States, or as one of the United States.  As these are rights, not  obligations, the State may resign or abdicate them and cease to  be a State, on the same principle that any man may abdicate or  forego his rights.  In doing so, the State breaks no oath of  allegiance, fails to fulfil no obligation she contracted as a  State: she simply forgoes her political rights and franchises.   So far, then, secession is possible, feasible, and not  unconstitutional or unlawful.  But it is, as Mr. Sumner and  others have maintained, simply State suicide.  Nothing hinders a  State from committing suicide, if she chooses, any more than  there was something which compelled the Territory to become a  State in the Union against its will.

It is objected to, this conclusion that the States were, prior to  the Union, independent sovereign States, and secession would not  destroy the State, but restore it to its original sovereignty and  independence, as the secessionists maintain.  Certainly, if the  States were, Prior to the Union, sovereign States; but this is  precisely what has been denied and disproved; for prior to the  Union there were no States.  Secession restores, or reduces,  rather, the State to the condition it was in before its admission  into the Union; but that condition 292                                    is that of Territory, or a  Territory subject to the United States, and not that of an  independent sovereign state.  The State holds all its political  rights and powers in the Union from the Union, and has none out  of it, or in the condition in which its population and domain  were before being a State in the Union.

State suicide, it has been urged, releases its population and  territory from their allegiance to the Union, and as there is no  rebellion where there is no allegiance, resistance by its  population and territory to the Union, even war against the  Union, would not be rebellion, but the simple assertion of  popular sovereignty.  This is only the same objection in another  form.  The lapse of the State releases the population and  territory from no allegiance to the Union; for their allegiance  to the Union was not contracted by their becoming a State, and  they have never in their State character owed allegiance to the  United States.  A State owes no allegiance to the United States,  for it is one of them, and is jointly sovereign.  The relation  between the United States and the State is not the relation of  suzerain and liegeman or vassal.  A State owes no allegiance, for  it is not subject to the Union; it is never in their State  capacity that its population and territory do or 293                                                  can rebel.   Hence, the Government has steadily denied that, in the late  rebellion, any State as such rebelled.

But as a State cannot rebel, no State can go out of the Union;  and therefore no State in the late rebellion has seceded, and the  States that passed secession ordinances are and all along have  been States in the Union.  No State can rebel, but it does not  follow therefrom that no State can secede or cease to exist as a  State: it only follows that secession, in the sense of State  suicide, or the abdication by the State of its political rights  and powers, is not rebellion.  Nor does it follow from the fact  that no State has rebelled, that no State has ceased to be a  State; or that the States that passed secession ordinances have  been all along States in the Union.

The secession ordinances were illegal, unconstitutional, not  within the competency of the State, and	therefore null and void  from the beginning.  Unconstitutional, illegal, and not within  the competency of the State, so far as intended to alienate any  portion of the national domain and population thereto annexed,  they certainly were, and so far were void and of no effect; but  so far as intended to take the State simply as a State out of the  Union, they were 294                  within the competency of the State, were not  illegal or unconstitutional, and therefore not null and void.   Acts unconstitutional in some parts and constitutional in others  are not wholly void.  The unconstitutionality vitiates only the  unconstitutional parts; the others are valid, are law, and  recognized and enforced as such by the courts.

The secession ordinances are void, because they were never passed  by the people of the State, but by a faction that overawed them  and usurped the authority of the State.  This argument implies  that, if a secession ordinance is passed by the people proper of  the State, it is valid; which is more than they who urge it  against the State suicide doctrine are prepared to concede.  But  the secession ordinances were in every instance passed by the  people of the State in convention legally assembled, therefore by  them in their highest State capacity--in the same capacity in  which they ordain and ratify the State constitution itself; and  in nearly all the States they were in addition ratified and  confirmed, if the facts have been correctly reported, by a  genuine plebiscitum, or direct vote of the people.  In all cases  they were adopted by a decided majority of the political people  of the State, and after their adoption they were 295                                                  acquiesced in  and indeed actively supported by very nearly the whole people.   The people of the States adopting the secession ordinances were  far more unanimous in supporting secession than the people of the  other States were in sustaining the Government in its efforts to suppress the rebellion by coercive measures.  It will not do,  then, to ascribe the secession ordinances to a faction.  The  people are never a faction, nor is a faction ever the majority.

There has been a disposition at the North, encouraged by the few  Union men at the South, to regard secession as the work of a few  ambitious and unprincipled leaders, who, by their threats, their  violence, and their overbearing manner, forced the mass of the  people of their respective States into secession against their  convictions and their will.  No doubt there were leaders at the  South, as there are in every great movement at the North; no  doubt there were individuals in the seceding States that held  secession wrong in principle, and were conscientiously attached  to the Union; no doubt, also, there were men who adhered to the  Union, not because they disapproved secession, but because they  disliked the men at the head of the movement, or because they  were keen-sighted enough to see that it could not 296                                                   succeed, that  the Union must be the winning side, and that by adhering to it  they would become the great and leading men of their respective  States, which they certainly could not be under secession.   Others sympathized fully with what was called the Southern cause,  held firmly the right of secession, and hated cordially the  Yankees, but doubted either the practicability or the expediency  of secession, and opposed it till resolved on, but, after it was  resolved on, yielded to none in their earnest support of it.   These last comprised the immense majority of those who voted  against secession.  Never could those called the Southern leaders  have carried the secession ordinances, never could they have  carried on the war with the vigor and determination, and with  such formidable armies as they collected and armed for four  years, making at times the destiny of the Union well nigh  doubtful, if they had not had the Southern heart with them, if  they had not been most heartily supported by the overwhelming  mass of the people.  They led a popular, not a factious movement.

No State, it is said again, has seceded, or could secede.  The  State is territorial, not personal, and as no State can carry its  territory and population out of the Union, no State can 297                                                         secede.   Out of the jurisdiction of the Union, or alienate them from the  sovereign or national domain, very true; but out of the Union as  a State, with rights, powers, or franchises in the Union, not  true.  Secession is political, not territorial.

But the State holds from the territory or domain.  The people are  sovereign because attached to a sovereign territory, not the  domain because held by a sovereign people, as was established by  the analysis of the early Roman constitution.  The territory of  the States corresponds to the sacred territory of Rome, to which  was attached the Roman sovereignty.  That territory, once  surveyed and consecrated, remained sacred and the ruling  territory, and could not be divested of its sacred and governing  character.  The portions of the territory of the United States  once erected into States and consecrated as ruling territory can  never be deprived, except by foreign conquest or successful  revolution, of its sacred character and inviolable rights.

The State is territorial, not personal, and is constituted by  public, not by private wealth, and is always respublica or  commonwealth, in distinction from despotism or monarchy in its  oriental sense, which is founded on private wealth, or which  assumes that the authority to 298                               govern, or sovereignty, is the  private estate of the sovereign.  All power is a domain, but  there is no domain without a dominus or lord.  In oriental  monarchies the dominus is the monarch; in republics it is the  public or people fixed to the soil or territory, that is, the  people in their territorial, and not in their personal or  genealogical relation.  The people of The United States are  sovereign only within the territory or domain of the United  States, and their sovereignty is a state, because fixed,  attached, or limited to that specific territory.  It is fixed to  the soil, not nomadic.  In barbaric nations power is nomadic and  personal, or genealogical, confined to no locality, but attaches  to the chief, and follows wherever he goes.  The Gothic chiefs  hold their power by a personal title, and have the same authority  in their tribes on the Po or the Rhone as on the banks of the  Elbe or the Danube.  Power migrates with the chief and his  people, and may be exercised wherever he and they find  themselves, as a Swedish queen held when she ordered the  execution of one of her subjects at Paris, without asking  permission of the territorial lord.  In these nations, power is a  personal right, or a private estate, not a state which exists  only as attached to the domain, and, as attached to the domain, 299 exists independently of the chief or the government.  The  distinction is between public domain and private domain.

The American system is republican, and, contrary to what some  democratic politicians assert, the American democracy is  territorial, not personal; not territorial because the majority  of the people are agriculturists or landholders, but because all  political rights, powers, or franchises are territorial.  The  sovereign people of the United States are sovereign only within  the territory of the United States.  The great body of the  freemen have the elective franchise, but no one has it save in  his State, his county, his town, his ward, his precinct.  Out of  the election district in which he is domiciled, a citizen of the  United States has no more right to vote than has the citizen or  subject of a foreign state.  This explains what is meant by the  attachment of power to the territory, and the dependence of the  state on the domain.  The state, in republican states, exists  only as inseparably united with the public domain; under  feudalism, power was joined to territory or domain, but the  domain was held as a private, not as a public domain.  All  sovereignty rests on domain or proprietorship, and is dominion.   The proprietor is the dominus or lord, and in 300                                               republican states  the lord is society, or the public, and the domain is held for  the common or public good of all.  All political rights are held  from society, or the dominus, and therefore it is the elective  franchise is held from society, and is a civil right, as  distinguished from a natural, or even a purely personal right.

As there is no domain without a lord or dominus, territory alone  cannot possess any political rights or franchises, for it is not  a domain.  In the American system, the dominus or lord is not the  particular State, but the United States, and, the domain of the  whole territory, whether erected into particular States or not,  is in the United States alone.  The United States do not part  with the dominion of that portion of the national domain included  within a particular State.  The State holds the domain not  separately but jointly, as inseparably one of the United States:  separated, it has no dominion, is no State, and is no longer a  joint sovereign at all, and the territory that it included falls  into the condition of any other territory held by the United  States not erected into one of the United States.

Lawyers, indeed, tell us that the eminent domain is in the  particular State, and that all escheats are to the State, not to  the United 301            States.  All escheats of private estates, but no  public or general escheats.  But this has nothing to do with the  public domain.  The United States are the dominus, but they have,  by the constitution, divided the powers of government between a  General government and particular State governments, and ordained  that all matters of a general nature, common to all the States,  should be placed under the supreme control of the former, and all  matters of a private or particular character under the supreme  control of the latter.  The eminent domain of private estates is  in the particular State, but the sovereign authority in the  particular State is that of the United States expressing itself  through the State government.  The United States, in the States  as well as out of them, is the dominus, as the States  respectively would soon find if they were to undertake to  alienate any part of their domain to a foreign power, or even to  the citizens or subjects of a foreign State, as is also evident  from the fact that the United States, in the way prescribed by  the constitution, may enlarge or contract at will the rights and  powers of the States.  The mistake on this point grows out of the  habit of restricting the action of the United States to the  General government, and not recollecting 302                                          that the United States  govern one class of subjects through the General government and  another class through State governments, but that it is one and  the same authority that governs in both.

The analogy borrowed from the Roman constitution, as far as  applicable, proves the reverse of what is intended.  The dominus  of the sacred territory was the city, or the Roman state, not the  sacred territory itself.  The territory received the tenant, and  gave him as tenant the right to a seat in the senate; but the  right of the territory was derived not from the domain, but from  the dominus, that is, the city.  But the city could revoke its  grant, as it practically did when it conferred the privileges of  Roman citizenship on the provincials, and gave to plebeians seats  in the senate.  Moreover, nothing in Roman history indicates that  to the validity of a senatus consultum it was necessary to count  the vacant domains of the sacred territory.  The particular  domain must, under the American system, be counted when it is  held by a State, but of itself alone, or even with its  population, it is not a State, and therefore as a State domain is  vacant and without any political rights or powers whatever.

To argue that the territory and population 303                                            once a State in the  Union must needs always be so, would be well enough if a State in  the Union were individually a sovereign state; for territory,  with its population not subject to another, is always a sovereign  state, even though its government has been subverted.  But this  is not the fact, for territory with its population does not  constitute a State in the Union; and, therefore, when of a State  nothing remains but territory and population, the State has  evidently disappeared.  It will not do then to maintain that  State suicide is impossible, and that the States that adopted  secession ordinances have never for a moment ceased to be States  in the Union, and are free, whenever they choose, to send their  representatives and senators to occupy their vacant seats in  Congress.  They must be reorganized first.

There would also be some embarrassment to the government in  holding that the States that passed the secession ordinance  remain, notwithstanding, States in the Union.  The citizens of a  State in the Union cannot be rebels to the United States, unless  they are rebels to their State; and rebels to their State they  are not, unless they resist its authority and make war on it.   The authority of the State in the Union is a legal authority, and  the citizen in obeying 304                        it is disloyal neither to the State nor to  the Union.  The citizens in the States that made war on the  United States did not resist their State, for they acted by its  authority.  The only men, on this supposition, in them, who have  been traitors or rebels, are precisely the Union men who have  refused to go with their respective States, and have resisted,  even with armed force, the secession ordinances.  The several  State governments, under which the so-called rebels carried on  the war for the destruction of the Union, if the States are in  the Union, were legal and loyal governments of their respective  States, for they were legally elected and installed, and  conformed to their respective State constitutions.  All the acts  of these governments have been constitutional.  Their entering  into a confederacy for attaining a separate nationality has been  legal, and the debts contracted by the States individually, or by  the confederacy legally formed by them, have been legally  contracted, stand good against them, and perhaps against the  United States.  The war against them has been all wrong, and the  confederates killed in battle have been murdered by the United  States.  The blockade has been illegal, for no nation can  blockade its own ports, and the captures and seizures under 305                                                             it,  robberies.  The Supreme Court has been wrong in declaring the war  a territorial civil war, as well as the government in acting  accordingly.  Now, all these conclusions are manifestly false and  absurd, and therefore the assumption that the States in question  have all along been States in the Union cannot be sustained.

It is easy to understand the resistance the Government offers to  the doctrine that a State may commit suicide, or by its own act  abdicate its rights and cease to be a State in the Union.  It is  admissible on no theory of the constitution that has been widely  entertained.  It is not admissible on Mr. Calhoun's theory of  State sovereignty, for on that theory a State in going out of the  Union does not cease to be a State but simply resumes the powers  it had delegated to the General government.  It cannot be  maintained on Mr. Madison's or Mr. Webster's theory, that the  States prior to the Union were severally sovereign, but by the  Union were constituted one people; for, if this one people are  understood to be a federal people, State secession would not be  State suicide, but State independence; and if understood to be  one consolidated or centralized people, it would be simply  insurrection or rebellion against the national  306                                                authority,  laboring to make itself a revolution.  The government seems to  have understood Mr. Madison's theory in both senses--in the  consolidated sense, in declaring the secessionists insurgents and  rebels, and in the federal sense, in maintaining that they have  never seceded, and are still States in the Union, in full  possession of all their political or State rights.  Perhaps, if  the government, instead of borrowing from contradictory theories  of the constitution which have gained currency, had examined in  the light of historical facts the constitution itself, it would  have been as constitutional in its doctrine as it has been loyal  and patriotic, energetic and successful in its military  administration.

Another reason why the doctrine that State secession is State  suicide has appeared so offensive to many, is the supposition  entertained at one time by some of its friends, that the  dissolution of the State vacates all rights and franchises held  under it.  But this is a mistake.  The principle is well known  and recognized by the jurisprudence of all civilized nations,  that in the transfer of a territory from one territorial  sovereign to another, the laws in force under the old sovereign  remain in force after the change, till abrogated, or others are  enacted 307         in their place by the new sovereign, except such as are  necessarily abrogated by the change itself of the sovereign; not,  indeed, because the old sovereign retains any authority, but,  because such is presumed by the courts to be the will of the new  sovereign.  The principle applies in the case of the death of a  State in the Union.  The laws of the State are territorial, till  abrogated by competent authority, remain the lex loci, and are in  full force.  All that would be vacated would be the public rights  of the State, and in no case the private rights of citizens,  corporations, or laws affecting them.

But the same conclusion is reached in another way.  In the lapse  of a State or its return to the condition of a Territory, there  is really no change of sovereignty.  The sovereignty, both before  and after, is the United States.  The sovereign authority that  governs in the State government, as we have seen, though  independent of the General government, is the United States.  The  United States govern certain matters through a General  government, and others through particular State governments.  The  private rights and interests created, regulated, or protected by  the particular State, are created, regulated, or protected by the  United States, as much and as plenarily as 308                                            if done by the General  government, and the State laws creating, regulating, or protecting  them can be abrogated by no power known to the constitution, but  either the State itself, or the United States in convention legally  assembled.  If this were what is meant by the States that have  seceded, or professed to secede, remaining States in the Union,  they would, indeed, be States still in the Union, notwithstanding  secession and the government would be right in saying that no  State can secede.  But this is not what is meant, at least not  all that is meant.  It is meant not only that the private rights  of citizens and corporations remain, but the citizens retain all  the public rights of the State, that is, the right to  representation in Congress and in the electoral college, and the  right to sit in the convention, which is not true.

But the correction of the misapprehension that the private rights  and interests are lost by the lapse of the State may remove the  graver prejudices against the doctrine of State suicide, and  dispose loyal and honest Union men to bear the reasons by which  it is supported, and which nobody has refuted or can refute on  constitutional grounds.  A Territory by coming into the Union  becomes a State; a State by going out of the Union becomes a  Territory.




CHAPTER XIII.

RECONSTRUCTION.


The question of reconstructing the States that seceded will be  practically settled before these pages can see the light, and  will therefore be considered here only so far as necessary to  complete the view of the constitution of the United States.  The  manner in which the government proposed to settle, has settled,  or will settle the question, proves that both it and the American  people have only confused views of the rights and powers of the  General government, but imperfectly comprehend the distinction  between the legislative and executive departments of that  Government, and are far more familiar with party tactics than  with constitutional law.

It would be difficult to imagine any thing more unconstitutional,  more crude, or more glaringly impolitic than the mode of  reconstruction indicated by the various executive proclamations  that have been issued, bearing on the subject, or even by the  bill for guaranteeing the States republican governments, that  passed 310        Congress, but which failed to obtain the President's  signature.  It is, in some measure, characteristic of the  American government to understand how things ought to be done  only when they are done and it is too late to do them in the  right way.  Its wisdom comes after action, as if engaged in a  series of experiments.  But, happily for the nation, few blunders  are committed that with our young life and elasticity are  irreparable, and that, after all, are greater than are ordinarily  committed by older and more experienced nations.  They are not of  the most fatal character, and are, for the most part, such as are  incident to the conceit, the heedlessness, the ardor, and the  impatience of youth, and need excite no serious alarm for the  future.

There has been no little confusion in the public mind, and in  that of the government itself, as to what reconstruction is, who  has the power to reconstruct, and how that power is to be  exercised.  Are the States that seceded States in the Union, with  no other disability than that of having no legal governments? or  are they Territories subject to the Union?  Is their  reconstruction their erection into new States, or their  restoration as States previously in the Union?  Is the power to  reconstruct in the States themselves? or is it in the General  government? 311              If partly in the people and partly in the General  government, is the part in the General government in Congress, or  in the Executive?  If in Congress, can the Executive, without the  authority of Congress, proceed to reconstruct, simply leaving it  for Congress to accept or reject the reconstructed State?   If  the power is partly in the people of the disorganized States who  or what defines that people, decides who may or may not vote in  the reorganization?  On all these questions there has been much  crude, if not erroneous, thinking, and much inconsistent and  contradictory action.

The government started with the theory that no State had seceded  or could secede, and held that, throughout, the States in  rebellion continued to be States in the Union.  That is, it held  secession to be a purely personal and not a territorial  insurrection.  Yet it proclaimed eleven States to be in  insurrection against the United States, blockaded their ports,  and interdicted all trade and intercourse of any kind with them.   The Supreme Court, in order to sustain the blockade and interdict  as legal, decided the war to be not a war against simply  individual or personal insurgents but "a territorial civil war."   This negatived the assumption that the States that took up arms  against  312         the United States remained all the while peaceable and  loyal States, with all their political rights and powers in the  Union.  The States in the Union are integral elements of the  political sovereignty, for the sovereignty of the American nation  vests in the States finite; and it is absurd to pretend that the  eleven States that made the rebellion and were carrying on a  formidable war against the United States, were in the Union, an  integral element of that sovereign authority which was carrying  on a yet more formidable war against them.  Nevertheless, the  government still held to its first assumption, that the States in  rebellion continued to be States in the Union--loyal States, with  all their rights and franchises unimpaired!

That the government should at first have favored or acquiesced in  the doctrine that no State had ceased to be a State in the Union,  is not to be wondered at.  The extent and determination of the  secession movement were imperfectly understood, and the belief  among the supporters of the government, and, perhaps, of the  government itself, was, that it was a spasmodic movement for a  temporary purpose, rather than a fixed determination to found an  independent separate nationality; that it was and would be  sustained by the real majority 313                                of the people of none of the  States, with perhaps the exception of South Carolina; that the  true policy of the government would be to treat the seceders with  great forbearance, to avoid all measures likely to exasperate  them or to embarrass their loyal fellow-citizens, to act simply  on the defensive, and to leave the Union men in the several  seceding States to gain a political victory at the polls over the  secessionists, and to return their States to their normal  position in the Union.

The government may not have had much faith in this policy, and  Mr. Lincoln's personal authority might be cited to the effect  that it had not, but it was urged strongly by the Union men of  the Border States.  The administration was hardly seated in  office, and its members were new men, without administrative  experience; the President, who had been legally elected indeed,  but without a majority of the popular votes, was far from having  the full confidence even of the party that elected him; opinions  were divided; party spirit ran high; the excitement was great,  the crisis was imminent, the government found itself left by its  predecessor without an army or a navy, and almost without arms or  ordnance; it knew not how far it could count on popular support,  and 314     was hardly aware whom it could trust or should distrust; all  was hurry and confusion; and what could the government do but to  gain time, keep off active war as long as possible, conciliate  all it could, and take ground which at the time seemed likely to  rally the largest number of the people to its support?  There  were men then, warm friends of the administration, and still  warmer friends of their country, who believed that a bolder, a  less timid, a less cautious policy would have been wiser, that in  revolutionary times boldness, what in other times would be  rashness, is the highest prudence, on the side of the government  as well as on the side of the revolution; that when once it has  shown itself, the rebellion that hesitates, deliberates, consults,  is defeated and so is the government.  The seceders owed from the  first their successes not to their superior organization, to  their better preparation, or to the better discipline and  appointment of their armies, but to their very rashness, to their  audacity even, and the hesitancy, cautious and deliberation of  the government.  Napoleon owed his successes as general and  civilian far more to the air of power he assumed, and the  conviction he produced of his invincibility in the minds of his  opponents, than to his civil or 315                                 military strategy and tactics,  admirable as they both were.  But the government believed it  wisest to adopt a conciliatory and, in many respects, a  temporizing policy, and to rely more on weakening the  secessionists in their respective States than on strengthening  the hands and hearts of its own staunch and uncompromising  supporters.  It must strengthen the Union party in the  insurrectionary States, and as this party hoped to succeed by  political manipulation rather than by military force, the  government must rely rather on a show of military power than on  gaining any decisive battle.  As it hoped, or affected to hope,  to suppress the rebellion in the States that seceded through  their loyal citizens, it was obliged to assume that secession was  the work of a faction, of a few ambitious and disappointed  politicians, and that the States were all in the Union, and  continued in the loyal portion of their inhabitants.  Hence its  aid to the loyal Virginians to organize as the State of Virginia,  and its subsequent efforts to organize the Union men in  Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, and its disposition to  recognize their organization in each of those States as the State  itself, though including only a small minority of the territorial  people.  Had the facts been 316                             as assumed, the government might have  treated the loyal people of each State as the State itself,  without any gross usurpation of power; but, unhappily, the facts  assumed were not facts, and it was soon found that the Union  party in all the States that seceded, except the western part of  Virginia and the eastern section of Tennessee, after secession  had been carried by the popular vote, went almost unanimously  with the secessionists; for they as well as the secessionists  held the doctrine of State sovereignty; and to treat the handful  of citizens that remained loyal in each State as the State  itself, became ridiculous, and the government should have seen  and acknowledged it.

The rebellion being really territorial, and not personal, the  State that seceded was no more continued in the loyal than in the  disloyal population.  While the war lasted, both were public  enemies of the United States, and neither had or could have any  rights as a State in the Union.  The law recognizes a solidarity  of all the citizens of a State, and assumes that, when a State is  at war, all its citizens are at war, whether approving the war or  not.  The loyal people in the States that seceded incurred none  of the pains and penalties of treason, but they retained none of  the political rights of the 317                             State in the Union, and, in  reorganizing the State after the suppression of the rebellion,  they have no more right to take part than the secessionists  themselves.  They, as well as the secessionists, have followed  the territory.  It was on this point that the government  committed its gravest mistake.  As to the reorganization or  reconstruction of the State, the whole territorial people stood  on the same footing.

Taking the decision of the Supreme Court as conclusive on the  subject, the rebellion was territorial, and, therefore, placed  all the States as States out of the Union, and retained them only  as population and territory, under or subject to the Union.  The  States ceased to exist, that is, as integral elements of the  national sovereignty.  The question then occurred, are they to be  erected into new States, or are they to be reconstructed and  restored to the Union as the identical old States that seceded?   Shall their identity be revived and preserved, or shall they be  new States, regardless of that identity ?  There can be no  question that the work to be done was that of restoration, not of  creation; no tribe should perish from Israel, no star be struck  from the firmament of the Union.  Every inhabitant of the fallen  States, and every citi- 318                       zen of the United States must desire them  to be revived and continued with their old names and boundaries,  and all true Americans wish to continue the constitution as it  is, and the Union as it was.  Who would see old Virginia, the  Virginia of revolutionary fame, of Washington, Jefferson,  Madison, of Monroe, the "Old Dominion," once the leading State of  the Union, dead without hope of resurrection? or South Carolina,  the land of Rutledge, Moultrie, Laurens, Hayne, Sumter, and  Marion?  There is something grating to him who values State  associations, and would encourage State emulation and State  pride, in the mutilation of the Old Dominion and the erection  within her borders of the new State called West Virginia.  States  in the Union are not mere prefectures, or mere dependencies on  the General government, created for the convenience of  administration.  They have an individual, a real existence of  their own, as much so as have the individual members of society.   They are free members, not of a confederation indeed, but of a  higher political community, and reconstruction should restore the  identity of their individual life, suspended for a moment by  secession, but capable of resuscitation.

These States had become, indeed, for a mo- 319                                          ment, territory under  the Union; but in no instance had they or could they become  territory that had never existed as States.  The fact that the  territory and people had existed as a State, could with regard to  none of them be obliterated, and, therefore, they could not be  erected into absolutely new States.  The process of  reconstructing them could not be the same as that of creating new  States.  In creating a new State, Congress, ex necessitate,  because there is no other power except the national convention  competent to do it, defines the boundaries of the new State, and  prescribes the electoral people, or who may take part in the  preliminary organization but in reconstructing States it does  neither, for both are done by a law Congress is not competent to  abrogate or modify, and which can be done only by the United  States in convention assembled, or by the State itself after its  restoration.  The government has conceded this, and, in part, has  acted on it.  It preserves, except in Virginia, the old  boundaries, and recognizes, or rather professes to recognize the  old electoral law, only it claims the right to exclude from the  electoral people those who have voluntarily taken part in the  rebellion.

The work to be done in States that have se- 320                                           ceded is that of  reconstruction, not creation; and this work is not and cannot be  done, exclusively nor chiefly by the General government, either  by the Executive or by Congress.  That government can appoint  military, or even provisional governors, who may designate the  time and place of holding the convention of the electoral people  of the disorganized State, as also the time and place of holding  the elections of delegates to it, and superintend the elections  so far as to see the polls are opened, and that none but  qualified electors vote, but nothing more.  All the rest is the  work of the territorial electoral people themselves, for the  State within its own sphere must, as one of the United States, be  a self-governing community.  The General government may concede  or withhold permission to the disorganized State to reorganize,  as it judges advisable, but it cannot itself reorganize it.  If it  concedes the permission, it must leave the whole electoral people  under the preexisting electoral law free to take part in the work  of reorganization, and to vote according to their own judgment.   It has no authority to purge the electoral people, and say who  may or may not vote, for the whole question of suffrage and the  qualifications of electors is left to the State, and can be  settled neither 321                 by an act of Congress nor by an Executive  proclamation.

If the government theory were admissible, that the disorganized  States remain States in the Union, the General government could  have nothing to say on the subject, and could no more interfere  with elections in any one of them than it could with elections in  Massachusetts or New York.  But even on the doctrine here  defended it can interfere with them only by way of general  superintendence.  The citizens have, indeed, lost their political  rights, but not their private rights.  Secession has not  dissolved civil society, or abrogated any of the laws of the  disorganized State that were in force at the time of secession.   The error of the government is not in maintaining that these laws  survive the secession ordinances, and remain the territorial law,  or lex loci, but in maintaining that they do so by will of the  State, that has, as a State, really lapsed.  They do so by will  of the United States, which enacted them through the individual  State, and which has not in convention abrogated them, save the  law authorizing slavery, and its dependent laws.

This point has already been made, but as it is one of the  niceties of the American constitution, it may not be amiss to  elaborate it at 322                 greater length.  The doctrine of Mr. Jefferson,  Mr. Madison, and the majority of our jurists, would see to be  that the States, under God, are severally sovereign in all  matters not expressly confided to the General government, and  therefore that the American sovereignty is divided, and the  citizen owes a double allegiance--allegiance to his State, and  allegiance to the United States--as if there was a United States  distinguishable from the States.  Hence Mr. Seward, in an  official dispatch to our minister at the court of St. James,  says: "The citizen owes allegiance to the State and to the United  States."  And nearly all who hold allegiance is due to the Union  at all, hold that it is also due to the States, only that which  is due to the United States is paramount, as that under feudalism  due to the overlord.  But this is not the case.  There is no  divided sovereignty, no divided allegiance.  Sovereignty is one,  and vests not in the General government or in the State  government, but in the United States, and allegiance is due to  the United States, and to them alone.  Treason can be committed  only against the United States, and against a State only because  against the United States, and is properly cognizable only by the  Federal courts.  Hence the Union men committed no treason in 323 refusing to submit to the secession ordinances of their  respective States, and in sustaining the national arms against  secession.

There are two very common mistakes: the one that the States  individually possess all the powers not delegated to the General  government; and the other that the Union, or United States, have  only delegated powers.  But the United States possess all the  powers of a sovereign state, and the States individually and the  General government possess only such powers as the United States  in convention delegate to them respectively.  The sovereign is  neither the General government nor the States severally, but the  United States in convention.  The United States are the one  indivisible sovereign, and this sovereign governs alike general  matters in the General government, and particular matters in the  several State governments.  All legal authority in either  emanates from this one indivisible and plenary sovereign, and  hence the law enacted by a State are really enacted by the United  States, and derive from them their force and vitality as laws.   Hence, as the United States survive the particular State, the  lapse of the State does not abrogate the State laws, or dissolve  civil society within its jurisdiction.

324 This is evidently so, because civil society in the particular  State does not rest on the State alone, nor on Congress, but on  the United States.  Hence all civil rights of every sort created  by the individual State are really held from the United States,  and therefore it was that the people of non-slaveholding States  were, as citizens of the United States, responsible for the  existence of slavery in the States that seceded.  There is a  solidarity of States in the Union as there is of individuals in  each of the States.  The political error of the Abolitionists was  not in calling upon the people of the United States to abolish  slavery, but in calling upon them to abolish it through the  General government, which had no jurisdiction in the case; or in  their sole capacity as men, on purely humanitarian grounds, which  were the abrogation of all government and civil society itself,  instead of calling upon them to do it as the United States in  convention assembled, or by an amendment to the constitution of  the United States in the way ordained by that constitution  itself.  This understood, the constitution and laws of a defunct  State remain in force by virtue of the will of the United States,  till the State is raised from the dead, restored to life and  activity, and repeals or al- 325                            ters them, or till they are repealed  or altered by the United States or the national convention.  But  as the defunct State could not, and the convention had not  repealed or altered them, save in the one case mentioned, the  General government had no alternative but to treat them and all  rights created by them as the territorial law, and to respect  them as such.

What then do the people of the several States that seceded lose  by secession?  They lose, besides incurring, so far as disloyal,  the pains and penalties of treason, their political rights, or  right, as has just been said, to be in their own department  self-governing communities, with the right of representation in  Congress and the electoral colleges, and to sit in the national  convention, or of being counted in the ratification of amendments  to the constitution--precisely what it was shown a Territorial  people gain by being admitted as a State into the Union.  This is  the difference between the constitutional doctrine and that  adopted by Mr. Lincoln's and Mr. Johnson's Administrations.  But  what authority, on this constitutional doctrine, does the General  government gain over the people of States that secede, that it  has not over others!  As to their internal 326                                            constitution, their  private rights of person or property, it gains none.  It has over  them, till they are reconstructed and restored to the Union, the  right to institute for them provisional governments, civil or  military, precisely as it has for the people of a territory that  is not and has never been one of the United States; but in their  reconstruction it has less, for the geographical boundaries and  electoral people of each are already defined by a law which does  not depend on its will, and which it can neither abrogate nor  modify.  Here is the difference between the constitutional  doctrine and that of the so-called radicals.  The State has gone,  but its laws remain, so far as the United States in convention  does not abrogate them; not because the authority of the State  survives, but because the United States so will, or are presumed  to will.  The United States have by a constitutional amendment  abrogated the laws of the several States authorizing slavery, and  prohibited slavery forever within the jurisdiction of the Union;  and no State can now be reconstructed and be admitted into the  Union with a constitution that permits slavery, for that would be  repugnant to the constitution of the United States.  If the  constitutional amendment is not recognized as rati- 327                                                   fied by the  requisite number of States, it is the fault of the government in  persisting in counting as States what are no States.  Negro  suffrage, as white suffrage, is at present a question for  States.

The United States guarantee to such State a republican form of  government.  And this guarantee, no doubt, authorizes Congress to  intervene in the internal constitution of a State so far as to  force it to adopt a republican form of government, but not so far  as to organize a government for a State, or to compel a  territorial people to accept or adopt a State constitution for  themselves.  If a State attempts to organize a form of government  not republican, it can prevent it; and if a Territory adopts an  unrepublican form, it can force it to change its constitution to  one that is republican, or compel it to remain a Territory under  a provisional government.  But this gives the General government  no authority in the organization or re-organization of States  beyond seeing that the form of government adopted by the  territorial people is republican.  To press it further, to make  the constitutional clause a pretext for assuming the entire  control of the organization or re-organization of a State, is a  manifest abuse--a palpable violation of the constitution and 328                                                              of  the whole American system.  The authority given by the clause is  specific, and is no authority for intervention in the general  reconstruction of the lapsed State.  It gives authority in no  question raised by secession or its consequences, and can give  none, except, from within or from without, there is an overt  attempt to organize a State in the Union with an unrepublican  form of government.

The General government gives permission to the territorial people  of the defunct State to re-organize, or it contents itself with  suffering them, without special recognition, to reorganize in  their own way, and apply to Congress for admission, leaving it to  Congress to admit them as a State, or not, according to its own  discretion, in like manner as it admits a new State; but the  re-organization itself must be the work of the territorial people  themselves, under their old electoral law.  The power that  reconstructs is in the people themselves; the power that admits  them, or receives them into the Union, is Congress.  The  Executive, therefore, has no authority in the matter, beyond that  of seeing that the laws are duly complied with; and whatever  power he assumes, whether by proclamation or by instructions  given to the provisional governors, civil or military, is  329                                                           simply  a usurpation of the power of Congress, which it rests with  Congress to condone or not, as it may see fit.  Executive  proclamations, excluding a larger or a smaller portion of the  electoral or territorial people from the exercise of the elective  franchise in reorganizing the State, and executive efforts to  throw the State into the hands of one political party or another,  are an unwarrantable assumption of power, for the President, in  relation to reconstruction, acts only under the peace powers of  the constitution, and simply as the first executive officer of  the Union.  His business is to execute the laws, not to make  them.  His legislative authority is confined to his qualified  veto on the acts of Congress, and to the recommendation to  Congress of such measures as he believes are needed by the  country.

In reconstructing a disorganized State, neither Congress nor the  Executive has any power that either has not in time of peace.   The Executive, as commander-in-chief of the army, may ex  necessitate, pace it ad interim under a military governor, but he  cannot appoint even a provisional civil governor till Congress  has created the office and given him authority to fill it; far  less can be legally give instructions to the civil governor as to  the mode or manner of recon- 330                            structing the disorganized State, or  decide who may or may not vote in the preliminary reorganization.   The Executive could do nothing of the sort, even in regard to a  Territory never erected into a State.  It belongs to Congress,  not to the Executive, to erect Territorial or provisional  governments, like those of Dacotah, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska,  and New Mexico; and, Congress, not the executive, determines the  boundaries of the Territory, passes the enabling act, and defines  the electoral people, till the State is organized and able to act  herself.  Even Congress, in reconstructing and restoring to life  and vigor in the Union a disorganized State, has nothing to say  as to its boundaries or its electoral people, nor any right to  interfere between parties in the State, to throw the  reconstructed State into the hands of one or another party.  All  that Congress can insist on is, that the territorial people shall  reconstruct with a government republican in form; that its  senators and representatives in Congress, and the members of the  State legislature, and all executive and judicial officers of the  State shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support and defend  the constitution of the United States.  In the whole work the  President has nothing to do with reconstruction, except to see  that 331      peace is preserved and the laws are fully executed.

It may be at least doubted that the Executive has power to  proclaim amnesty and pardon to rebels after the civil war has  ceased, and ceased it has when the rebels have thrown down their  arms and submitted; for his pardoning power is only to pardon  after conviction and judgment of the court: it is certain that he  has no power to proscribe or punish even traitors, except by due  process of law.  When the war is over he has only his ordinary  peace powers.  He cannot then disfranchise any portion of the  electoral people of a State that seceded, even though there is no  doubt that they have taken part in the rebellion, and may still  be suspected of disloyal sentiments.  Not even Congress can do  it, and no power known to the constitution till the State is  reconstructed can do it without due process of law, except the  national convention.  Should the President do any of the things  supposed, he would both abuse the power he has and usurp power  that he has not, and render himself liable to impeachment.  There  are many things very proper, and even necessary to be done, which  are high crimes when done by an improper person or agent.  The  duty of the President, when there are 332                                       steps to be taken or things  to be done which he believes very necessary, but which are not  within his competency, is, if Congress is not in session, to  call it together at the earliest practicable moment, and submit  the matter to its wisdom and discretion.

It must be remembered that the late rebellion was not a merely  personal but a territorial rebellion.  In such a rebellion,  embracing eleven States, and, excluding slaves, a population of  at least seven millions, acting under an organized territorial  government, preserving internal civil order, supporting an army  and navy under regularly commissioned officers, and carrying on  war as a sovereign nation--in such a territorial rebellion no one  in particular can be accused and punished as a traitor.  The  rebellion is not the work of a few ambitious or reckless leaders,  but of the people, and the responsibility of the crime, whether  civil or military, is not individual, but common to the whole  territorial people engaged in it; and seven millions, or the half  of them, are too many to ban to exile, or even to disfranchise Their defeat and the failure of their cause must be their  punishment.  The interest of the country, as well the sentiment  of the civilized world--it might almost be said the law of  nations--demands their permission 333                                   to return to their allegiance,  to be treated according to their future merits, as an integral  portion of the American people.

The sentiment of the civilized world has much relaxed from its  former severity toward political offenders.  It regards with  horror the savage cruelties of Great Britain to the unfortunate  Jacobites, after their defeat under Charles Edward, at Culloden,  in 1746, their barbarous treatment of the United Irishmen in  1798, and her brutality to the mutinous Hindoos in 1857-'58; the  harshness of Russia toward the insurgent Poles, defeated in their  mad attempts to recover their lost nationality; the severity of  Austria, under Haynau, toward the defeated Magyars.  The liberal  press kept up for years, especially in England and the United  States, a perpetual howl against the Papal and Neapolitan  governments for arresting and imprisoning men who conspired to  overthrow them.  Louis Kossuth was no less a traitor than  Jefferson Davis, and yet the United States solicited his release  from a Turkish prison, and sent a national ship to bring him  hither as the nation's guest.  The people of the United States  have held from the first "the right of insurrection," and have  given their moral support to every insurrection in the Old or New  World they discovered, and for them 334                                     to treat with severity any  portion of the Southern secessionists, who, at the very worst,  only acted on the principles the nation had uniformly avowed and  pronounced sacred, would be regarded, and justly, by the  civilized world as little less than infamous.

Not only the fair fame, but the interest of the Union forbids any  severity toward the people lately in arms against the government.   The interest of the nation demands not the death or the expulsion  of the secessionists, and, least of all, of those classes  proscribed by the President's proclamation of the 29th of May,  1865, nor even their disfranchisement, perpetual or temporary;  but their restoration to citizenship, and their loyal  co-operation with all true-hearted Americans, in hearing the  wounds inflicted on the whole country by the civil war.  There  need be no fear to trust them.  Their cause is lost; they may or  may not regret it, but lost it is, and lost forever.  They  appealed to the ballot-box, and were defeated; they appealed from  the ballot-box to arms, to war, and have been again defeated,  terribly defeated.  They know it and feel it.  There is no  further appeal for them; the judgment of the court of last resort  has been rendered, and rendered against them.  The cause is  finished, the controversy closed, 335                                   never to be re-opened.   Henceforth the Union is invincible, and it is worse than idle to  attempt to renew the war against it.  Henceforth their lot is  bound up with that of the nation, and all their hopes and  interests, for themselves and their children, and their  children's children, depend on their being permitted to demean  themselves henceforth as peaceable and loyal American citizens.   They must seek their freedom, greatness, and glory in the  freedom, greatness, and glory of the American republic, in which,  after all, they can be far freer, greater, more glorious than in  a separate and independent confederacy.  All the arguments and  considerations urged by Union men against their secession, come  back to them now with redoubled force to keep them henceforth  loyal to the Union.

They cannot afford to lose the nation, and the nation cannot  afford to lose them.  To hang or exile them, and depopulate and  suffer to run to waste the lands they had cultivated, were sad  thrift, sadder than that of deporting four millions of negroes  and colored men.  To exchange only those excepted from amnesty  and pardon by President Johnson, embracing some two millions or  more, the very pars sanior of the Southern population, for what  would re- 336         main or flock in to supply their place, would be only the  exchange of Glaucus and Diomed, gold for brass; to disfranchise  them, confiscate their estates, and place them under the  political control of the freedmen, lately their slaves, and the  ignorant and miserable "white trash," would be simply to render  rebellion chronic, and to convert seven millions of Americans,  willing and anxious to be free, loyal American citizens,  eternal enemies.  They have yielded to superior numbers and  resources; beaten, but not disgraced, for they have, even in  rebellion, proved themselves what they are--real Americans.  They  are the product of the American soil, the free growth of the  American republic, and to disgrace them were to disgrace the  whole American character and people.

The wise Romans never allowed a triumph to a Roman general for  victories, however brilliant, won over Romans.  In civil war, the  victory won by the government troops is held to be a victory for  the country, in which all parties are victors, and nobody is  vanquished.  It was as truly for the good of the secessionists to  fail, as it was for those, who sustained the government to  succeed; and the government having forced their submission and  vindicated its own author- 337                          ity, it should now leave them to enjoy,  with others, the victory which it his won for the common good of  all.  When war becomes a stern necessity, when it breaks out, and  while it lasts, humanity requires it to be waged in earnest,  prosecuted with vigor, and made as damaging, as distressful to  the enemy as the laws of civilized nations permit.  It is the way  to bring it to a speedy close, and to save life and property.   But when it is over, when the enemy submits, and peace returns,  the vanquished should be treated with gentleness and love.  No  rancor should remain, no vengeance should be sought; they who met  in mortal conflict on the battle-field should be no longer  enemies, but embrace as comrades, as friends, as brothers.  None  but a coward kicks a fallen foe; a brave people is generous, and  the victors in the late war can afford to be generous generously.   They fought for the Union, and the Union has no longer an enemy;  their late enemies are willing and proud to be their countrymen,  fellow-citizens, and friends; and they should look to it that  small politicians do not rob them in the eyes of the world, by  unnecessary and ill-timed severity to the submissive, of the  glory of being, as they are, a great, noble, chivalric, generous,  and magnanimous people.

338 The government and the small politicians, who usually are the  most influential with all governments, should remember that none  of the secessionists, however much in error they have been, have  committed the moral crime of treason.  They held, with the  majority of the American people, the doctrine of State  sovereignty, and on that doctrine they had a right to secede, and  have committed no treason, been guilty of no rebellion.  That  was, indeed, no reason why the government should not use all its  force, if necessary, to preserve the national unity and the  integrity of the national domain; but it is a reason, and a  sufficient reason, why no penalty of treason should be inflicted  on secessionists or their leaders, after their submission, and  recognition of the sovereignty of the United States as that to  which they owe allegiance.  None of the secessionists have been  rebels or traitors, except in outward act, and there can, after  the act has ceased, be no just punishment where there has been no  criminal intent.  Treason is the highest crime, and deserves  exemplary punishment; but not where there has been no treasonable  intent, where they who committed it did not believe it was  treason, and on principles held by the majority of their  countrymen, and by the party that had gener- 339                                            ally held the  government, there really was no treason.  Concede State  sovereignty, and Jefferson Davis was no traitor in the war he  made on the United States, for he made none till his State had  seceded.  He could not then be arraigned for his acts after  secession, and at most, only for conspiracy, if at all, before  secession.

But, if you permit all to vote in the re-organization of the  State who, under the old electoral law, have the elective  franchise, you throw the State into the hands of those who have  been disloyal to the Union.  If so, and you cannot trust them,  the remedy is not in disfranchising the majority, but in  prohibiting re-organization, and in holding the territorial  people still longer under the provisional government, civil or  military.  The old electoral law disqualifies all who have been  convicted of treason either to the State or the United States,  and neither Congress nor the Executive can declare any others  disqualified on account of disloyalty.  But you must throw the  State into the hands of those who took part, directly or  indirectly, in the rebellion, if you reconstruct the States at  all, for they are undeniably the great body of the territorial  people in all the States that seceded.  These people having  submitted, and declared their intention to reconstruct the State  as a 340      State in the Union, you must amend the constitution of the  United States, unless they are convicted of a disqualifying crime  by due process of law, before you can disfranchise them.  It is  impossible to reconstruct any one of the disorganized States with  those alone, or as the dominant party, who have adhered to the  Union throughout the fearful struggle, as self-governing States.   The State, resting on so small a portion of the people, would  have no internal strength, no self-support, and could stand only  as upheld by federal arms, which would greatly impair the free  and healthy action of the whole American system.

The government attempted to do it in Virginia, Louisiana,  Arkansas, and Tennessee, before the rebellion was suppressed, but  without authority and without success.  The organizations,  effected at great expense, and sustained only by military force,  were neither States nor State governments, nor capable of being  made so by any executive or congressional action.  If the  disorganized States, as the government held, were still States in  the Union, these organizations were flagrantly revolutionary, as  effected not only without, but in defiance of State authority; if  they had seceded and ceased to be States, as was the fact, they  were equally 341              unconstitutional and void of authority, because not  created by the free suffrage of the territorial people, who alone  are competent to construct or reconstruct a state.

If the Unionists had retained the State organization and  government, however small their number, they would have held the  State, and the government would have been bound to recognize and  to defend them as such with all the force of the Union.  The  rebellion would then have been personal, not territorial.  But  such was not the case.  The State organization, the State  government, the whole State authority rebelled, made the  rebellion territorial, not personal, and left the Unionists, very  respectable persons assuredly, residing, if they remained at  home, in rebel territory, traitors in the eye of their respective  States, and shorn of all political status or rights.  Their  political status was simply that of the old loyalists, or  adherents of the British crown in the American war for  Independence, and it was as absurd to call them the State, as it  would have been for Great Britain to have called the old Tories  the colonies.

The theory on which the government attempted to re-organize the  disorganized States rested on two false assumptions: first, that  the 342                people are personally sovereign; and, second, that all the  power of the Union vests in the General government.  The first,  as we have seen, is the principle of so-called "squatter  sovereignty," embodied in the famous Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which  gave birth, in opposition, to the Republican party of 1856.  The  people are sovereign only as the State, and the State is  inseparable from the domain.  The Unionists without the State  government, without any State organization, could not hold the  domain, which, when the State organization is gone, escheats to  the United States, that is to say, ceases to exist.  The American  democracy is territorial, not personal.

The General government, in time of war or rebellion, is indeed  invested, for war purposes, with all the power of the Union.   This is the war power.  But, though apparently unlimited, the war  power is yet restricted to war purposes, and expires by natural  limitation when peace returns;, and peace returns, in a civil  war, when the rebels have thrown down their arms and submitted to  the national authority, and without any formal declaration.   During the war, or while the rebellion lasts, it can suspend the  civil courts, the civil laws, the State constitutions, any thing  necessary to the success of the 343                                 war--and of the necessity the  military authorities are the judges; but it cannot abolish,  abrogate, or reconstitute them.  On the return of peace they  revive of themselves in all their vigor.  The emancipation  proclamation of the President, if it emancipated the slaves in  certain States and parts of States, and if those whom it  emancipated could not be re-enslaved, did not anywhere abolish  slavery, or change the laws authorizing it; and if the Government  should be sustained by Congress or by the Supreme Court in  counting the disorganized States as States in the Union, the  legal status of slavery throughout the Union, with the exception  of Maryland, and perhaps Missouri, is what it was before the  war.*

The Government undoubtedly supposed, in the reconstructions it  attempted, that it was acting under the war power; but as  reconstruction can never be necessary for war purposes, and as it  is in its very nature a work of peace, incapable of being  effected by military force, since its validity depends entirely  on its being the free action of the territorial people to be  reconstructed, the General government had and could have, with  regard to it, only its ordinary

* This was the case in August, 1865.  It may be quite otherwise  before these pages see the light.

344                                          peace powers.  Reconstruction is  jure pacis, not jure belli.

Yet such illegal organizations, though they are neither States  nor State governments, and incapable of being legalized by any  action of the Executive or of Congress, may, nevertheless, be  legalized by being indorsed or acquiesced in by the territorial  people.  They are wrong, as are all usurpations; they are  undemocratic, inasmuch as they attempt to give the minority the  power to rule the majority; they are dangerous inasmuch as they  place the State in the hands of a party that can stand only as  supported by the General government, and thus destroy the proper  freedom and independence of the State, and open the door to  corruption, tend to keep alive rancor and ill feeling, and to  retard the period of complete pacification, which might be  effected in three months as well as in three years, or twenty  years; yet they can become legal, as other governments illegal in  their origin become legal, with time and popular acquiescence.   The right way is always the shortest and easiest; but when a  government must oftener follow than lead the public, it is not  always easy to hit the right way, and still less easy to take it.   The general instincts of the people are right as to the end  345                                                             to be  gained, but seldom right as to the means of gaining it; and  politicians of the Union party, as well as of the late secession  party, have an eye in reconstructing, to the future political  control of the State when it is reconstructed.

The secessionists, if permitted to retain their franchise, would,  even if they accepted abolition, no doubt re-organize their  respective States on the basis of white suffrage, and so would  the Unionists, if left to themselves.  There is no party at the  South prepared to adopt negro suffrage, and there would be none  at the North if the negroes constituted any considerable portion  of the population.  As the reconstruction of a State cannot be  done under the war power, the General government can no more  enfranchise than it can disfranchise any portion of the  territorial people, and the question of negro suffrage must be  left, where the constitution leaves it--to the States severally,  each to dispose of it for itself.  Negro suffrage will, no doubt,  come in time, as soon as the freedmen are prepared for it, and  the danger is that it will be attempted too soon.

It would be a convenience to have the negro vote in the  reconstruction of the States disorganized by secession, for it  would secure their re-construction with antislavery  constitutions, and also 346                         make sure of the proposed antislavery  amendment to the Constitution of the United States; but there is  no power in Congress to enfranchise the negroes in the States  needing reconstruction, and, once assured of their freedom, the  freedmen would care little for the Union, of which they  understand nothing.  They would vote, for the most part, with  their former masters, their employers, the wealthier and more  intelligent classes, whether loyal or disloyal; for, as a rule,  these will treat them with greater personal consideration and  kindness than others.  The dislike of the negro, and hostility to  negro equality, increase as you descend in the social scale.  The  freedmen, without political instruction or experience, who have  had no country, no domicile, understand nothing of loyalty or of  disloyalty.  They have strong local attachments, but they can  have no patriotism.  If they adhered to the Union in the  rebellion, fought for it, bled for it, it was not from loyalty,  but because they knew that their freedom could come only from the  success of the Union arms.  That freedom secured, they have no  longer any interest in the Union, and their local attachments,  personal associations, habits, tastes, likes and dislikes, are  Southern, not Northern.  In any contest between the 347                                                     North and the  South, they would take, to a man, the Southern side.  After the  taunts of the women, the captured soldiers of the Union found,  until nearly the last year of the war, nothing harder to bear,  when marched as prisoners into Richmond, than the antics and  hootings of the negroes.  Negro suffrage on the score of loyalty,  is at best a matter of indifference to the Union, and as the  elective franchise is not a natural right, but a civil trust, the  friends of the negro should, for the present, be contented with  securing him simply equal rights of person and property.




348 CHAPTER XIV.

POLITICAL TENDENCIES.


The most marked political tendency of the American people has  been, since 1825, to interpret their government as a pure and  simple democracy, and to shift it from a territorial to a purely  popular basis, or from the people as the state, inseparably  united to the national territory or domain, to the people as  simply population, either as individuals or as the race.  Their  tendency has unconsciously, therefore, been to change their  constitution from a republican to a despotic, or from a civilized  to a barbaric constitution.

The American constitution is democratic, in the sense that the  people are sovereign that all laws and public acts run in their  name; that the rulers are elected by them, and are responsible to  them; but they are the people territorially constituted and fixed  to the soil, constituting what Mr. Disraeli, with more propriety  perhaps than he thinks, calls a "territorial democracy."  To this  territorial democracy, the real American democracy, stand opposed  two 349     other democracies--the one personal and the other  humanitarian--each alike hostile to civilization, and tending to  destroy the state, and capable of sustaining government only on  principles common to all despotisms.

In every man there is a natural craving for personal freedom and  unrestrained action--a strong desire to be himself, not  another--to be his own master, to go when and where he pleases,  to do what he chooses, to take what he wants, wherever he can  find it, and to keep what he takes.  It is strong in all nomadic  tribes, who are at once pastoral and predatory, and is seldom  weak in our bold frontier-men, too often real "border ruffians."   It takes different forms in different stages of social  development, but it everywhere identifies liberty with power.   Restricted in its enjoyment to one man, it makes him chief, chief  of the family, the tribe, or the nation; extended in its  enjoyment to the few, it founds an aristocracy, creates a  nobility--for nobleman meant originally only freeman, as it does  350 his own consent, express or constructive.  This is the so-called  Jeffersonian democracy, in which government has no powers but  such as it derives from the consent of the governed, and is  personal democracy or pure individualism philosophically  considered, pure egoism, which says, "I am God."  Under this sort  of democracy, based on popular, or rather individual sovereignty,  expressed by politicians when they call the electoral people,  half seriously, half mockingly, "the sovereigns," there obviously  can be no state, no social rights or civil authority; there can  be only a voluntary association, league, alliance, or  confederation, in which individuals may freely act together as  long as they find it pleasant, convenient, or useful, but from  which they may separate or secede whenever they find it for their  interest or their pleasure to do so.  State sovereignty and  secession are based on the same democratic principle applied to  the several States of the Union instead of individuals.

The tendency to this sort of democracy has been strong in large  sections of the American people from the first, and has been  greatly strengthened by the general acceptance of the theory that  government originates in compact.  The full realization of this  tendency, which, hap- 351                     pily, is impracticable save in theory, would  be to render every man independent alike of every other man and  of society, with full right and power to make his own will  prevail.  This tendency was strongest in the slaveholding States,  and especially, in those States, in the slaveholding class, the  American imitation of the feudal nobility of mediaeval Europe;  and on this side the war just ended was, in its most general  expression, a war in defence of personal democracy or the  sovereignty of the people individually, against the humanitarian  democracy, represented by the abolitionists, and the territorial  democracy, represented by the Government.  This personal  democracy has been signally defeated in the defeat of the late  confederacy, and can hardly again become strong enough to be  dangerous.

But the humanitarian democracy, which scorns all geographical  lines, effaces all in individualities, and professes to plant  itself on humanity alone, has acquired by the war new strength,  and is not without menace to our future.  The solidarity of the  race, which is the condition of all human life, founds, as we  have seen, society, and creates what are called social rights,  the, rights alike of society in regard to individuals, and of  individuals in regard to society.   352                                    Territorial divisions or  circumscriptions found particular societies, states, or nations;  yet as the race is one and all its members live by communion with  God through it and by communion one with another, these  particular states or nations are never absolutely independent of  each other but, bound together by the solidarity of the race, so  that there is a real solidarity of nations as well as of  individuals--the truth underlying Kossuth's famous declaration of  the solidarity of peoples."

The solidarity of nations is the basis of international law,  binding on every particular nation, and which every civilized  nation recognizes and enforces on its own subjects or citizens  through its own courts as an integral part of its own municipal  or national law.

The personal or individual right is therefore restricted by the  rights of society, and the rights of the particular society or  nation are limited by international law, or the rights of  universal society--the truth the ex-governor of Hungary  overlooked.  The grand error of Gentilism was in denying the  unity and therefore the solidarity of the race, involved in its  denial or misconception of the unity of God.  It therefore was  never able to assign any solid basis to international law, and  gave it only a 353                conventional or customary authority, thus leaving  the jus gentium, which it recognized in deed, without any real  foundation in the constitution of things, or authority in the  real world.  Its real basis is in the solidarity of the race,  which has its basis in the unity of God, not the dead or abstract  unity asserted by the old Eleatics, the Neo-Platonists, or the  modern Unitarians, but the living unity consisting in the  threefold relation in the Divine Essence, of Father, Son, and  Holy Ghost, as asserted by Christian revelation, and believed,  more or less intelligently, by all Christendom.

The tendency in the Southern States has been to overlook the  social basis of the state, or the rights of society founded on  the solidarity of the race, and to make all rights and powers  personal, or individual; and as only the white race has been able  to assert and maintain its personal freedom, only men of that  race are held to have the right to be free.  Hence the people of  those States felt no scruple in holding the black or colored race  as slaves. Liberty, said they, is the right only of those who  have the ability to assert and maintain it.  Let the negro prove  that he has this ability by asserting and maintaining his  freedom, and he will prove his right to be free, 354                                                  and that it is a  gross outrage, a manifest injustice, to enslave him; but, till  then, let him be my servant, which is best for him and for me.   Why ask me to free him?  I shall by doing so only change the form  of his servitude.  Why appeal to me!  Am I my brother's keeper?  Nay, is he my brother?  Is this negro, more like an ape or a  baboon than a human being, of the same race with myself?  I  believe it not.  But in some instances, at least, my dear  slaveholder, your slave is literally your brother, and sometimes  even your son, born of your own daughter.  The tendency of the  Southern democrat was to deny the unity of the race, as well as  all obligations of society to protect the weak and helpless, and  therefore all true civil society.

At the North there has been, and is even yet, an opposite  tendency--a tendency to exaggerate the social element, to  overlook the territorial basis of the state, and to disregard the  rights of individuals.  This tendency has been and is strong in  the people called abolitionists.  The American abolitionist is so  engrossed with the unity that he loses the solidarity of the  race, which supposes unity of race and multiplicity of  individuals; and falls to see any thing legitimate and  authoritative in 355                  geographical divisions or territorial  circumscriptions.  Back of these, back of individuals, he sees  humanity, superior to individuals, superior to states,  governments, and laws, and holds that he may trample on them all  or give them to the winds at the call of humanity or "the higher  law."  The principle on which he acts is as indefensible as the  personal or egoistical democracy of the slaveholders and their  sympathizers.  Were his socialistic tendency to become exclusive  and realized, it would found in the name of humanity a complete  social despotism, which, proving impracticable from its very  generality, would break up in anarchy, in which might makes  right, as in the slaveholder's democracy.

The abolitionists, in supporting themselves on humanity in its  generality, regardless of individual and territorial rights, can  recognize no state, no civil authority, and therefore are as much  out of the order of civilization, and as much in that of  barbarism, as is the slaveholder himself.  Wendell Phillips is as  far removed from true Christian civilization as was John C.  Calhoun, and William Lloyd Garrison is as much of a barbarian and  despot in principle and tendency as Jefferson Davis.  Hence the  great body of the people in the non-slaveholding States, wedded  to American democracy as they 354                               were and are could never, as much  as they detested slavery, be induced to make common cause with  the abolitionists, and their apparent union in the late civil war  was accidental, simply owing to the fact that for the time the  social democracy and the territorial coincides or had the same  enemy.  The great body of the loyal people instinctively felt  that pure socialism is as incompatible with American democracy as  pure individualism; and the abolitionists are well aware that  slavery has been abolished, not for humanitarian or socialistic  reasons but really for reasons of state, in order to save the  territorial democracy.  The territorial democracy would not unite  to eliminate even so barbaric an element as slavery, till the  rebellion gave them the constitutional right to abolish it; and  even then so scrupulous were they, that they demanded a  constitutional amendment, so as to be able to make clean work of  it, without any blow to individual or State rights.

The abolitionists were right in opposing slavery, but not in  demanding its abolition on humanitarian or socialistic grounds.   Slavery is really a barbaric element, and is in direct antagonism  to American civilization.  The whole force of the national life  opposes it, and must finally eliminate it, or become itself  extinct 357         and it is no mean proof of their utter want of sympathy  with all the living forces of modern civilization, that the  leading men of the South and their prominent friends at the North  really persuaded themselves that with cotton, rice, and tobacco,  they could effectually resist the anti-slavery movement, and  perpetuate their barbaric democracy.  They studied the classics,  they admired Greece and Rome, and imagined that those nations  became great by slavery, instead of being great even in spite of  slavery.  They failed to take into the account the fact that when  Greece and Rome were in the zenith of their glory, all  contemporary nations were also slaveholding nations, and that if  they were the greatest and most highly civilized nations of their  times, they were not fitted to be the greatest and most highly  civilized nations of all times.  They failed also to perceive  that, if the Graeco-Roman republic did not include the whole  territorial people in the political people, it yet recognized  both the social and the territorial foundation of the state, and  never attempted to rest it on pure individualism; they forgot,  too, that Greece and Rome both fell, and fell precisely through  internal weakness caused by the barbarism within, not through the  force of the barbarism 358                        beyond their frontiers.  The world has  changed since the time when ten thousand of his slaves were  sacrificed as a religious offering to the manes of a single Roman  master.  The infusion of the Christian dogma of the unity and  solidarity of the race into the belief, the life, the laws, the  jurisprudence of all civilized nations, has doomed slavery and  every species of barbarism; but this our slaveholding countrymen  saw not.

It rarely happens that in any controversy, individual or  national, the real issue is distinctly presented, or the precise  question in debate is clearly and distinctly understood by either  party.  Slavery was only incidentally involved in the late war.   The war was occasioned by the collision of two extreme parties;  but it was itself a war between civilization and barbarism,  primarily between the territorial democracy and the personal  democracy, and in reality, on the part of the nation, as much a  war against the socialism of the abolitionist as against the  individualism of the slaveholder.  Yet the victory, though  complete over the former, is only half won over the latter, for  it has left the humanitarian democracy standing, and perhaps for  the moment stronger than ever.  The socialistic democracy was  enlisted by the territorial, not to strengthen the government at 359 home, as it imagines, for that it did not do, and could not do,  since the national instinct was even more opposed to it than to  the personal democracy; but under its antislavery aspect, to  soften the hostility of foreign powers, and ward off foreign  intervention, which was seriously threatened.  The populations of  Europe, especially of France and England, were decidedly  anti-slavery, and if the war here appeared to them a war, not  solely for the unity of the nation and the integrity of its  domain, as it really was, in which they took and could take no  interest, but a war for the abolition of slavery, their  governments would not venture to intervene.  This was the only  consideration that weighed with Mr. Lincoln, as he himself  assured the author, and induced him to issue his Emancipation  Proclamation; and Europe rejoices in our victory over the  rebellion only so far as it has liberated the slaves, and honors  the late President only as their supposed liberator, not as the  preserver of the unity and integrity of the nation.  This is  natural enough abroad, and proves the wisdom of the anti-slavery  policy of the government, which had become absolutely necessary  to save the Republic long before it was adopted; yet it is not as  the emancipator of some two or three 360                                      millions of slaves that the  American patriot cherishes the memory of Abraham Lincoln, but,  aided by the loyal people, generals of rare merit, and troops of  unsurpassed bravery and endurance, as the saviour of the American  state, and the protector of modern civilization.  His  anti-slavery policy served this end, and therefore was wise, but  he adopted it with the greatest possible reluctance.

There were greater issues in the late war than negro slavery or  negro freedom.  That was only an incidental issue, as the really  great men of the Confederacy felt, who to save their cause were  willing themselves at last to free and arm their own negroes, and  perhaps were willing to do it even at first.  This fact alone  proves that they had, or believed they had, a far more important  cause than the preservation of negro slavery.  They fought for  personal democracy, under the form of State sovereignty, against  social democracy; for personal freedom and independence against  social or humanitarian despotism; and so far their cause was as  good as that against which they took up arms; and if they had or  could have fought against that, without fighting at the same time  against the territorial, the real American, the only civilized  democracy, they 361                 would have succeeded.  It is not socialism nor  abolitionism that has won; nor is it the North that has  conquered.  The Union itself has won no victories over the South,  and it is both historically and legally false to say that the  South has been subjugated.  The Union has preserved itself and  American civilization, alike for North and South, East and West.   The armies that so often met in the shock of battle were not  drawn up respectively by the North and the South, but by two  rival democracies, to decide which of the two should rule the  future.  They were the armies of two mutually antagonistic  systems, and neither army was clearly and distinctly conscious of  the cause for which it was shedding its blood; each obeyed  instinctively a power stronger than itself, and which at best it  but dimly discerned.  On both sides the cause was broader and  deeper than negro slavery, and neither the proslavery men nor the  abolitionists have won.  The territorial democracy alone has won,  and won what will prove to be a final victory over the purely  personal democracy, which had its chief seat in the Southern  States, though by no means confined to them.  The danger to  American democracy from that quarter is forever removed, and  democracy a' la Rousseau has 362                              received a terrible defeat  throughout the world, though as yet it is far from being aware of  it.

But in this world victories are never complete.  The socialistic  democracy claims the victory which has been really won by the  territorial democracy, as if it had been socialism, not  patriotism, that fired the hearts and nerved the arms of the  brave men led by McClellan, Grant, and Sherman.  The  humanitarians are more dangerous in principle than the egoists,  for they have the appearance of building on a broader and deeper  foundation, of being more Christian, more philosophic, more  generous and philanthropic; but Satan is never more successful  than under the guise of an angel of light.  His favorite guise in  modern times is that of philanthropy.  He is a genuine  humanitarian, and aims to persuade the world that humanitarianism  is Christianity, and that man is God; that the soft and charming  sentiment of philanthropy is real Christian charity; and he dupes  both individuals and nations, and makes them do his work, when  they believe they are earnestly and most successfully doing the  work of God.  Your leading abolitionists are as much affected by  satanophany as your leading confederates, nor are they one whit  more philosophical or less sophistical.  The one 363                                                  loses the race,  the other the individual, and neither has learned to apply  practically that fundamental truth that there is never the  general without the particular, nor the particular without the  general, the race without individuals, nor individuals without  the race.  The whole race was in Adam, and fell in him, as we are  taught by the doctrine of original sin, or the sin of the race,  and Adam was an individual, as we are taught in the fact that  original sin was in him actual or personal sin.

The humanitarian is carried away by a vague generality, and loses  men in humanity, sacrifices the rights of men in a vain endeavor  to secure the rights of man, as your Calvinist or his brother  Jansenist sacrifices the rights of nature in order to secure the  freedom of grace.  Yesterday he agitated for the abolition of  slavery, to-day he agitates for negro suffrage, negro equality,  and announces that when be has secured that be will agitate for  female suffrage and the equality of the sexes, forgetting or  ignorant that the relation of equality subsists only between  individuals of the same sex; that God made the man the head of  the woman, and the woman for the man, not the man for the woman.   Having obliterated all distinction of sex in politics, in social,  in- 364   dustrial, and domestic arrangements, he must go farther, and  agitate for equality of property.  But since property, if  recognized at all, will be unequally acquired and distributed, he  must go farther still, and agitate for the total abolition of  property, as an injustice, a grievous wrong, a theft, with  M. Proudhon, or the Englishman Godwin.  It is unjust that one  should have what another wants, or even more than another.  What  right have you to ride in your coach or astride your spirited  barb while I am forced to trudge on foot?  Nor can our  humanitarian stop there.  Individuals are, and as long as there  are individuals will be, unequal: some are handsomer and some are  uglier, some wiser or sillier, more or less gifted, stronger or  weaker, taller or shorter, stouter or thinner than others, and  therefore some have natural advantages which others have not.   There is inequality, therefore injustice, which can be remedied  only by the abolition of all individualities, and the reduction  of all individuals to the race, or humanity, man in general.  He  can find no limit to his agitation this side of vague generality,  which is no reality, but a pure nullity, for he respects no  territorial or individual circumscriptions, and must regard  creation itself as a blunder.  This is not fancy, for he has 365 gone very nearly as far as it is here shown, if logical, be must  go.

The danger now is that the Union victory will, at home and  abroad, be interpreted as a victory won in the interest of social  or humanitarian democracy.  It was because they regarded the war  waged on the side of the Union as waged in the interest of this  terrible democracy, that our bishops and clergy sympathized so  little with the Government in prosecuting it; not, as some  imagined, because they were disloyal, hostile to American or  territorial democracy, or not heartily in favor of freedom for  all men, whatever their race or complexion.  They had no wish to  see slavery prolonged, the evils of which they, better than any  other class of men, knew, and more deeply deplored; none would  have regretted more than they to have seen the Union broken up;  but they held the socialistic or humanitarian democracy  represented by Northern abolitionists as hostile alike to the  Church and to civilization.  For the same reason that they were  backward or reserved in their sympathy, all the humanitarian  sects at home and abroad were forward and even ostentatious in  theirs.  The Catholics feared the war might result in encouraging  La Republiques democratique et sociale; the humanitarian sects  366 trusted that it would.  If the victory of the Union should turn  out to be a victory for the humanitarian democracy, the civilized  world will have no reason to applaud it.

That there is some danger that for a time the victory will be  taken as a victory for humanitarianism or socialism, it would be  idle to deny.  It is so taken now, and the humanitarian party  throughout the world are in ecstasies over it.  The party claim  it.  The European Socialists and Red Republicans applaud it, and  the Mazzinis and the Garibaldis inflict on us the deep  humiliation of their congratulations.  A cause that can be  approved by the revolutionary leaders of European Liberals must  be strangely misunderstood, or have in it some infamous element.   It is no compliment to a nation to receive the congratulations of  men who assert not only people-king, but people-God; and those  Americans who are delighted with them are worse enemies to the  American democracy than ever were Jefferson Davis and his fellow  conspirators, and more contemptible, as the swindler is more  contemptible than the highwayman.

But it is probable the humanitarians have reckoned without their  host.  Not they are the real victors.  When the smoke of battle  has 367     cleared away, the victory, it will be seen, has been won by  the Republic, and that that alone has triumphed.  The  abolitionists, in so far as they asserted the unity of the race  and opposed slavery as a denial of that unity, have also won; but  in so far as they denied the reality or authority of territorial  and individual circumscriptions, followed a purely socialistic  tendency, and sought to dissolve patriotism into a watery  sentimentality called philanthropy, have in reality been  crushingly defeated, as they will find when the late  insurrectionary States are fully reconstructed.  The Southern or  egoistical democrats, so far as they denied the unity and  solidarity of the race, the rights of society over individuals,  and the equal rights of each and every individual in face of the  state, or the obligations of society to protect the weak and help  the helpless, have been also defeated; but so far as they  asserted personal or individual rights which society neither  gives nor can take away, and so far as they asserted, not State  sovereignty, but State rights, held independently of the General  government, and which limit its authority and sphere of action,  they share in the victory, as the future will prove.

European Jacobins, revolutionists, conspiring openly or secretly  against all legitimate author- 368                              ity, whether in Church or State,  have no lot or part in the victory of the American people: not  for them nor for men with their nefarious designs or mad dreams,  have our brave soldiers fought, suffered and bled for four years  of the most terrible war in modern times, and against troops as  brave and as well led as themselves; not for them has the country  sacrificed a million of lives, and contracted a debt of four  thousand millions of dollars, besides the waste and destruction  that it will take years of peaceful industry to repair.  They and  their barbaric democracy have been defeated, and civilization has  won its most brilliant victory in all history.  The American  democracy has crushed, actually or potentially, every species of  barbarism in the New World, asserted victoriously the state, and  placed the government definitively on the side of legitimate  authority, and made its natural association henceforth with all  civilized governments--not with the revolutionary movements to  overthrow them.  The American people will always be progressive  as well as conservative; but they have learned a lesson, which  they much needed against false democracy: civil war has taught  them that "the sacred right of insurrection" is as much out of  place in a democratic state as in an aristocratic or a mon- 369                                                           archical  state; and that the government should always be clothed with  ample authority to arrest and punish whoever plots its  destruction.  They must never be delighted again to have their  government send a national ship to bring hither a noted traitor  to his own sovereign as the nation's guest.  The people of the  Northern States are hardly less responsible for the late  rebellion than the people of the Southern States.  Their press  had taught them to call every government a tyranny that refused  to remain quiet while the traitor was cutting its throat or  assassinating the nation, and they had nothing but mad  denunciations of the Papal, the Austrian, and the Neapolitan  governments for their severity against conspirators and traitors.   But their own government has found it necessary for the public  safety to be equally arbitrary, prompt, and severe, and they will  most likely require it hereafter to co-operate with the  governments of the Old World in advancing civilization, instead  of lending all its moral support, as heretofore, to the Jacobins,  revolutionists, socialists, and humanitarians, to bring back the  reign of barbarism.

The tendency to individualism has been sufficiently checked by  the failure of the rebellion, and no danger from the  disintegrating  370                element, either in the particular State or in the  United States, is henceforth to be apprehended.  But the tendency  in the opposite direction may give the American state some  trouble.  The tendency now is, as to the Union, consolidation,  and as to the particular state, humanitarianism, socialism, or  centralized democracy.  Yet this tendency, though it may do much  mischief, will hardly become exclusive.  The States that seceded,  when restored, will always, even in abandoning State sovereignty,  resist it, and still assert State rights.  When these States are  restored to their normal position, they will always be able to  protect themselves against any encroachments on their special  rights by the General government.  The constitution, in the  distribution of the powers of government, provides the States  severally with ample means to protect their individuality against  the centralizing tendency of the General government, however  strong it may be.

The war has, no doubt, had a tendency to strengthen the General  government, and to cause the people, to a great extent, to look  upon it as the supreme and exclusive national government, and to  regard the several State governments as subordinate instead of  co-ordinate governments.  It is not improbable that the  Executive, since 371                  the outbreak of the rebellion, has proceeded  throughout on that supposition, and hence his extraordinary  assumptions of power; but when once peace is fully re-established  and the States have all resumed their normal position in the  Union, every State will be found prompt enough to resist any  attempt to encroach on its constitutional rights.  Its instinct  of self-preservation will lead it to resist, and it will be  protected by both its own judiciary and that of the United  States.

The danger that the General government will usurp the rights of  the States is far less than the danger that the Executive will  usurp all the powers of Congress and the judiciary.  Congress,  during the rebellion, clothed the President, as far as it could,  with dictatorial powers, and these powers the Executive continues  to exercise even after the rebellion is suppressed.  They were  given and held under the rights of war, and for war purposes  only, and expired by natural limitation when the war ceased; but  the Executive forgets this, and, instead of calling Congress  together and submitting the work of reconstruction of the States  that seceded to its wisdom and authority, undertakes to  reconstruct them himself, as if he were an absolute sovereign;  372 and the people seem to like it.  He might and should, as  commander-in-chief of the army and navy, govern them as military  departments, by his lieutenants, till Congress could either  create provisional civil governments for them or recognize them  as self-governing States in the Union; but he has no right, under  the constitution nor under the war power, to appoint civil  governors, permanent or provisional; and every act he has done in  regard to reconstruction is sheer usurpation, and done without  authority and without the slightest plea of necessity.  His acts  in this respect, even if wise and just in themselves, are  inexcusable, because done by one who has no legal right to do  them.  Yet his usurpation is apparently sustained by public  sentiment, and a deep wound is inflicted on the constitution,  which will be long in healing.

The danger in this respect is all the greater because it did not  originate with the rebellion, but had manifested itself for a  long time before.  There is a growing disposition on the part of 

Congress to throw as much of the business of government as  possible into the hands of the Executive.  The patronage the  Executive wields, even in times of peace, is so large that he has  indirectly an almost supreme control 373                                      over the legislative branch  of the government.  For this, which is, and, if not checked will  continue to be, a growing evil, there is no obvious remedy,  unless the President is chosen for a longer term of office and  made ineligible for a second term, and the mischievous doctrine  of rotation in office is rejected as incompatible with the true  interests of the public.  Here is matter for the consideration of  the American statesman.  But as to the usurpations of the  Executive in these unsettled times, they will be only temporary,  and will cease when the States are all restored.  They are  abuses, but only temporary abuses, and the Southern States, when  restored to the Union, will resume their rights in their own  sphere, as self-governing communities, and legalize or undo the  unwarrantable acts of the Federal Executive.

The socialistic and centralizing tendency in the bosom of the  individual States is the most dangerous, but it will not be able  to become predominant; for philanthropy, unlike charity, does not  begin at home, and is powerless unless it operates at a distance.   In the States in which the humanitarian tendency is the  strongest, the territorial democracy has its most effective  organization.  Prior to the outbreak of the rebellion the  American people had asserted 374                              popular sovereignty, but had never  rendered an account to themselves in what sense the people are or  are not sovereign.  They had never distinguished the three sorts  of democracy from one another, asked themselves which of the  three is the distinctively American democracy.  For them,  democracy was democracy, and those who saw dangers ahead sought  to avoid them either by exaggerating one or the other of the two  exclusive tendencies, or else by restraining democracy itself  through restrictions on suffrage.  The latter class began to  distrust universal suffrage, to lose faith in the people, and to  dream of modifying the American constitution so as to make it  conform more nearly to the English model.  The war has proved  that the were wrong, for nothing is more certain than that the  people have saved the national unity and integrity almost in  spite of their government.  The General government either was not  disposed or was afraid to take a decided stand against secession,  till forced to do it by the people themselves.  No wise American  can henceforth distrust American democracy.  The people may be  trusted.  So much is settled.  But as the two extremes were  equally democratic, as the secessionists acted in the name of  popular sovereignty, and as the humanitarians 375                                               were not unwilling  to allow separation, and would not and did not engage in the war  against secession for the sake of the Union and the integrity of  the national domain, the conviction becomes irresistible that it  was not democracy in the sense of either of the extremes that  made the war and came out of it victorious; and hence the real  American democracy must differ from them both, and is neither a  personal nor a humanitarian, but a territorial democracy.  The  true idea of American democracy thus comes out, for the first  time, freed from the two extreme democracies which have been  identified with it, and henceforth enters into the understandings  as well as the hearts of the people.  The war has enlightened  patriotism, and what was sentiment or instinct becomes reason--a  well-defined, and clearly understood constitutional conviction.

In the several States themselves there are many things to prevent  the socialistic tendency from becoming exclusive.  In the States  that seceded socialism has never had a foothold, and will not  gain it, for it is resisted by all the sentiments, convictions,  and habits of the Southern people, and the Southern people will  not be exterminated nor swamped by migrations either from the  North or from Europe.  They are and 376                                     always will be an  agricultural people, and an agricultural people are and always  will be opposed to socialistic dreams, unless unwittingly held  for a moment to favor it in pursuit of some special object in  which they take a passionate interest.  The worst of all policies  is that of hanging, exiling, or disfranchising the wealthy  landholders of the South, in order to bring up the poor and  depressed whites, shadowed forth in the Executive proclamation of  the 29th of May, 1865.  Of course that policy will not be carried  out, and if the negroes are enfranchised, they will always vote  with the wealthy landholding class, and aid them in resisting all  socialistic tendencies.  The humanitarians will fail for the want  of a good social grievance against which they can declaim.

In the New England States the humanitarian tendency is strong as  a speculation, but only in relation to objects at a distance.  It  is aided much by the congregational constitution of their  religion; yet it is weak at home, and is resisted practically by  the territorial division of power.  New England means  Massachusetts, and nowhere is the subdivision of the powers of  government carried further, or the constitution of the  territorial democracy more complete, than in that State.   Philanthropy sel- 377                 dom works in private against private vices and  evils: it is effective only against public grievances, and the  farther they are from home and the less its right to interfere  with them, the more in earnest and the more effective for evil  does it become.  Its nature is to mind every one's business but  its own.  But now that slavery is abolished, there is nowhere in  the United States a social grievance of magnitude enough to  enlist any considerable number of the people, even of  Massachusetts, in a movement to redress it.  Negro  enfranchisement is a question of which the humanitarians can make  something and they will make the most of it; but as it is a  question that each State will soon settle for itself, it will not  serve their purpose of prolonged agitation.  They could not and  never did carry away the nation, even on the question of slavery  itself, and abolitionism had comparatively little direct  influence in abolishing slavery; and the exclusion of negro  suffrage can never be made to appear to the American people as  any thing like so great a grievance as was slavery.

Besides, in all the States that did not secede, Catholics are a  numerous and an important portion of the population.  Their  increasing numbers, wealth, and education secure them, as much 378 as the majority may dislike their religion, a constantly  increasing influence, and it is idle to leave them out in  counting the future of the country.  They will, in a very few  years, be the best and most thoroughly educated class of the  American people; and, aside from their religion, or, rather, in  consequence of their religion, the most learned, enlightened, and  intelligent portion of the American population; and as much as  they have disliked the abolitionists, they have, in the army and  elsewhere, contributed their full share to the victory the nation  has won.  The best things written on the controversy have been  written by Catholics, and Catholics are better fitted by their  religion to comprehend the real character of the American  constitution than any other class of Americans, the moment they  study it in the light of their own theology.  The American  constitution is based on that of natural society, on the  solidarity of the race, and the difference between natural  society and the church or Christian society is, that the one is  initial and the other teleological.  The law of both is the same;  Catholics, as such, must resist both extremes, because each is  exclusive, and whatever is exclusive or one-sided is uncatholic.   If they have been backward in their sympathy with 379                                                   the government,  it has been through their dislike of the puritanic spirit and the  humanitarian or socialistic elements they detected in the  Republican party, joined with a prejudice against political and  social negro equality.  But their church everywhere opposes the  socialistic movements of the age, all movements in behalf of  barbarism, and they may always be counted on to resist the  advance of the socialistic democracy.  If the country has had  reason to complain of some of them in the late war, it will have,  in the future, far stronger reason to be grateful; not to them,  indeed, for the citizen owes his life to his country, but to  their religion, which has been and is the grand protectress of  modern society and civilization.

>From the origin of the government there has been a tendency to  the extension of suffrage, and to exclude both birth and private  property as bases of political rights or franchises.  This  tendency has often been justified on the ground that the elective  franchise is a natural right; which is not true, because the  elective franchise is political power, and political power is  always a civil trust, never a natural right, and the state judges  for itself to whom it will or will not confide the trust; but  there can be no doubt that it is a normal tendency, and in strict 380 accordance with the constitution of American civil society, which  rests on the unity of the race, and public instead of private  property.  All political distinctions founded on birth, race, or  private wealth are anomalies in the American system, and are  necessarily eliminated by its normal developments.  To contend  that none but property-holders may vote, or none but persons of a  particular race may be enfranchised, is unamerican and contrary,  to the order of civilization the New World is developing.  The  only qualification for the elective franchise the American system  can logically insist on is that the elector belong to the  territorial people--that is, be a natural-born or a naturalized  citizen, be a major in full possession of his natural faculties,  and unconvicted of any infamous offence.  The State is free to  naturalize foreigners or not, and under such restrictions as it  judges proper; but, having naturalized them, it must treat them  as standing on the same footing with natural-born citizens.

The naturalization question is one of great national importance.   The migration of foreigners hither has added largely to the  national population, and to the national wealth and resources,  but less, perhaps, to the development of patriotism, the purity  of elections, or the 381                      wisdom and integrity of the government.  It  is impossible that there should be perfect harmony between the  national territorial democracy and individuals born, brought up,  and formed under a political order in many respects widely  different from it; and there is no doubt that the democracy, in  its objectionable sense, has been greatly strengthened by the  large infusion of naturalized citizens.  There can be no question  that, if the laboring classes, in whom the national sentiment is  usually the strongest, had been composed almost wholly of native  Americans, instead of being, as they were, at least in the  cities, large towns, and villages, composed almost exclusively of  persons foreign born, the Government would have found far less  difficulty in filling up the depleted ranks of its armies.  But  to leave so large a portion of the actual population as the  foreign born residing in the country without the rights of  citizens, would have been a far graver evil, and would, in the  late struggle, have given the victory to secession.  There are  great national advantages derived from the migration hither of  foreign labor, and if the migration be encouraged or permitted,  naturalization on easy and liberal terms is the wisest, the best,  and only safe policy.  The children of foreign-born parents are  real Americans.

382 Emigration has, also, a singular effect in developing the latent  powers of the emigrant, and the children of emigrants are usually  more active, more energetic than the children of the older  inhabitants of the country among whom they settle.  Some of our  first men in civil life have been sons of foreign-born parents,  and so are not a few of our greatest and most successful  generals.  The most successful of our merchants have been  foreign-born.  The same thing has been noticed elsewhere,  especially in the emigration of the French Huguenots to Holland,  Germany, England, and Ireland.  The immigration of so many  millions from the Old World has, no doubt, given to the American  people much of their bold, energetic, and adventurous character,  and made them a superior people on the whole to what they would  otherwise have been.  This has nothing to do with superiority or  inferiority of race or blood, but is a natural effect of breaking  men away from routine, and throwing them back on their own  individual energies and personal resources.

Resistance is offered to negro suffrage, and justly too, till the  recently emancipated slaves have served an apprenticeship to  freedom; but that resistance cannot long stand before the onward  progress of American democracy, which 383                                       asserts equal rights for  all, and not for a race or class only.  Some would confine  suffrage to landholders, or, at least, to property-holders; but  that is inconsistent with the American idea, and is a relic of  the barbaric constitution which founds power on private instead  of public wealth.  Nor are property-owners a whit more likely to  vote for the public good than are those who own no property but  their own labor.  The men of wealth, the business men,  manufacturers and merchants, bankers and brokers, are the men who  exert the worst influence on government in every country, for  they always strive to use it as an instrument of advancing their  own private interests.  They act on the beautiful maxim, "Let  government take care of the rich, and the rich will take care of  the poor," instead of the far safer maxim, "Let government take  care of the weak, the strong can take care of themselves."  Universal suffrage is better than restricted suffrage, but even  universal suffrage is too weak to prevent private property from  having an undue political influence.

The evils attributed to universal suffrage are not inseparable  from it, and, after all, it is doubtful if it elevates men of an  inferior class to those elevated by restricted suffrage.  The  Congress of 1860, or of 1862. was a fair average 384                                                  of the wisdom,  the talent, and the virtue of the country, and not inferior to  that of 1776, or that of l789; and the Executive during the  rebellion was at least as able and as efficient as it was during  the war of 1812, far superior to that of Great Britain, and not  inferior to that of France during the Crimean war.  The Crimean  war developed and placed in high command, either with the English  or the French, no generals equal to Halleck, Grant, and Sherman,  to say nothing of others.  The more aristocratic South proved  itself, in both statesmanship and generalship, in no respect  superior to the territorial democracy of the North and West.

The great evil the country experiences is not from universal  suffrage, but from what may be called rotation in office.  The  number of political aspirants is so great that, in the Northern  and Western States especially, the representatives in Congress  are changed every two or four years, and a member, as soon as he  has acquired the experience necessary to qualify him for his  position, is dropped, not through the fickleness of his  constituency, but to give place to another whose aid had been  necessary to his first or second election.  Employes are  "rotated," not because they are incapable or unfaithful, but  because there are others who want their places. 385                                                  This is all bad,  but it springs not from universal suffrage, but from a wrong  public opinion, which might be corrected by the press, but which  is mainly formed by it.  There is, no doubt, a due share of  official corruption, but not more than elsewhere, and that would  be much diminished by increasing the salaries of the public  servants, especially in the higher offices of the government,  both General and State.  The pay to the lower officers and  employes of the government, and to the privates and  non-commissioned officers in the army, is liberal, and, in  general, too liberal; but the pay of the higher grades in both  the civil and military service is too low, and relatively far  lower than it was when the government was first organized.

The worst tendency in the country, and which is not encouraged at  all by the territorial democracy, manifests itself in hostility  to the military spirit and a standing army.  The depreciation of  the military spirit comes from the humanitarian or sentimental  democracy, which, like all sentimentalisms, defeats itself, and  brings about the very evils it seeks to avoid.  The hostility to  standing armies is inherited from England, and originated in the  quarrels between king and parliament, and is a  386                                                striking evidence  of the folly of that bundle of antagonistic forces called the  British constitution.  In feudal times most of the land was held  by military service, and the reliance of government was on the  feudal militia; but no real progress was made in eliminating  barbarism till the national authority got a regular army at its  command, and became able to defend itself against its enemies.   It is very doubtful if English civilization has not, upon the  whole, lost more than it has gained by substituting parliamentary  for royal supremacy, and exchanging the Stuarts for the Guelfs.

No nation is a living, prosperous nation that has lost the  military spirit, or in which the profession of the soldier is not  held in honor and esteem; and a standing army of reasonable size  is public economy.  It absorbs in its ranks a class of men who  are worth more there than anywhere else; it creates honorable  places for gentlemen or the sons of gentlemen without wealth, in  which they can serve both themselves and their country.  Under a  democratic government the most serious embarrassment to the state  is its gentlemen, or persons not disposed or not fitted to  support themselves by their own hands, more necessary in a  democratic government than in any other.  The civil 387                                                     service,  divinity, law, and medicine, together with literature, science,  and art, cannot absorb the whole of this ever-increasing class,  and the army and navy would be an economy and a real service to  the state were they maintained only for the sake of the rank and  position they give to their officers, and the wholesome influence  these officers would exert on society and the politics of the  country--this even in case there were no wars or apprehension of  wars.  They supply an element needed in all society, to sustain  in it the chivalric and heroic spirit, perpetually endangered by  the mercantile and political spirit, which has in it always  something low and sordid.

But wars are inevitable, and when a nation has no surrounding  nations to fight, it will, as we have just proved, fight itself.   When it can have no foreign war, it will get up a domestic war;  for the human animal, like all animals, must work off in some way  its fighting humor, and the only sure way of maintaining peace is  always to be prepared for war.  A regular standing army of forty  thousand men would have prevented the Mexican war, and an army of  fifty thousand well-disciplined and efficient troops at the  command of the President on his inauguration in March, 1861,  would have pre- 388               vented the rebellion, or have instantly suppressed  it.  The cost of maintaining a land army of even a hundred  thousand men, and a naval force to correspond, would have been,  in simple money value, only a tithe of what the rebellion has  cost the nation, to say nothing of the valuable lives that have  been sacrificed for the losses on the rebel side, as well as  those on the side of the government, are equally to be counted.   The actual losses to the country have been not less than six or  eight thousand millions of dollars, or nearly one-half the  assessed value of the whole property of the United States  according to the census returns of 1860, and which has only been  partially cancelled by actual increase of property since.  To  meet the interest on the debt incurred will require a heavier sum  to be raised annually by taxation, twice over, without  discharging a cent of the principal, than would have been  necessary to maintain an army and navy adequate to the protection  of peace and the prevention of the rebellion.

The rebellion is now suppressed, and if the government does not  blunder much more in its civil efforts at pacification than it  did in its military operations, before 1868 things will settle  down into their normal order; but a regular army--not militia or  volunteers, who are  389                     too expensive--of at least a hundred thousand  men of all arms, and a navy nearly as large as that of England or  France, will be needed as a peace establishment.  The army of a  hundred thousand men must form a cadre of an army of three times  that number, which will be necessary to place the army on a war  footing.  Less will answer neither for peace nor war, for the  nation has, in spite of herself, to maintain henceforth the rank  of a first-class military and maritime power, and take a leading  part in political movements of the civilized world, and, to a  great extent, hold in her hand the peace of Europe.

Canning boasted that be had raised up the New World to redress  the balance of the Old: a vain boast, for he simply weakened  Spain and gave the hegemony of Europe to Russia, which the  Emperor of the French is trying, by strengthening Italy and  Spain, and by a French protectorate in Mexico, to secure to  France, both in the Old World and the New--a magnificent dream,  but not to be realized.  His uncle judged more wisely when he  sold Louisiana, left the New World to itself, and sought only to  secure to France the hegemony of the Old.  But the hegemony of  the New World henceforth belongs to the United States, and she  will have 390           a potent voice in adjusting the balance of power even  in Europe.  To maintain this position, which is imperative on  her, she must always have a large armed force, either on foot or  in reserve, which she can call out and put on a war footing at  short notice.  The United States must henceforth be a great  military and naval power, and the old hostility to a standing  army and the old attempt to bring the military into disrepute  must be abandoned, and the country yield to its destiny.

Of the several tendencies mentioned, the humanitarian tendency,  egoistical at the South, detaching the individual from the race  and socialistic at the North, absorbing the individual in the  race, is the most dangerous.  The egoistical form is checked,  sufficiently weakened by the defeat of the rebels; but the social  form believes that it has triumphed, and that individuals are  effaced in society, and the States in the Union.  Against this,  more especially should public opinion and American statesmanship  be now directed, and territorial democracy and the division of  the powers of government be asserted and vigorously maintained.   The danger is that while this socialistic form of democracy is  conscious of itself, the territorial democracy has not yet  arrived, as the Germans 391                         say, at self  consciousness--selbsbewusstseyn--and operates only instinctively.   All the dominant theories and sentimentalities are against it,  and it is only Providence that can sustain it.




392 CHAPTER XV.

DESTINY-POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS.


It has been said in the Introduction to this essay that every  living nation receives from Providence a special work or mission  in the progress of society, to accomplish which is its destiny,  or the end for which it exists; and that the special mission of  the United States is to continue and complete in the political  order the Graeco-Roman civilization.

Of all the states or colonies on this continent, the American  Republic alone has a destiny, or the ability to add any thing to  the civilization of the race.  Canada and the other British  Provinces, Mexico and Central America, Columbia and Brazil, and  the rest of the South American States, might be absorbed in the  United States without being missed by the civilized world.  They  represent no idea, and the work of civilization could go on  without them as well as with them.  If they keep up with the  progress of civilization, it is all that can be expected of them.   France, England, Germany, and Italy might absorb the rest of  Europe, and 393             all Asia and Africa, without withdrawing a single  laborer from the work of advancing the civilization of the race;  and it is doubtful if these nations themselves can severally or  jointly advance it much beyond the point reached by the Roman  Empire, except in abolishing slavery and including in the  political people the whole territorial people.  They can only  develop and give a general application to the fundamental  principles of the Roman constitution.  That indeed is much, but  it adds no new element nor new combination of preexisting  elements.  But nothing of this can be said of the United States.

In the Graeco-Roman civilization is found the state proper, and  the great principle of the territorial constitution of power,  instead of the personal or the genealogical, the patriarchal or  the monarchical; and yet with true civil or political principles  it mixed up nearly all the elements of the barbaric constitution.   The gentile system of Rome recalls the patriarchal, and the  relation that subsisted between the patron and his clients has a  striking resemblance to that which subsists between the feudal  lord and his retainers, and may have had the same origin.  The  three tribes, Ramnes, Quirites, and Luceres, into which the Roman 394 people were divided before the rise of the plebs, may have been,  as Niebuhr contends, local, not genealogical, in their origin,  but they were not strictly territorial distinctions, and the  division of each tribe into a hundred houses or gentes was not  local, but personal, if not, as the name implies, genealogical.   No doubt the individuals or families composing the house or gens  were not all of kindred blood, for the Oriental custom of  adoption, so frequent with our North American Indians, and with  all people distributed into tribes, septs, or clans, obtained  with the Romans.  The adopted member was considered a child of  the house, and took its name and inherited its goods.  Whether,  as Niebuhr maintains, all the free gentiles of the three tribes  were called patres or patricians or whether the term was  restricted to the heads of houses, it is certain that the head of  the house represented it in the senate, and the vote in the  curies was by houses, not by individuals en masse.  After all,  practically the Roman senate was hardly less an estate than the  English house of lords, for no one could sit in it unless a  landed proprietor and of noble blood.  The plebs, though outside  of the political people proper, as not being included in the  three tribes, when they came to be a 395                                      power in the republic under  the emperors, and the old distinction of plebs and patricians was  forgotten, were an estate, and not a local or territorial people.

The republican element was in the fact that the land, which gave  the right to participate in political power, was the domain of  the state, and the tenant held it from the state.  The domain was  vested in the state, not in the senator nor the prince, and was  therefore respublica, not private property--the first grand leap  of the human race from barbarism.  In all other respects the  Roman constitution was no more republican than the feudal.   Athens went farther than Rome, and introduced the principle of  territorial democracy.  The division into demes or wards, whence  comes the word democracy, was a real territorial division, not  personal nor genealogical.  And if the equality of all men was  not recognized, all who were included in the political class  stood on the same footing.  Athens and other Greek cities, though  conquered by Rome, exerted after their conquest a powerful  influence on Roman civilization, which became far more democratic  under the emperors than it had been under the patrician senate,  which the assassins of Julius Caesar, and the superannuated  conservative party they 396                         represented, tried so hard to preserve.   The senate and the consulship were opened to the representatives  of the great plebeian houses, and the provincials were clothed  with the rights of Roman citizens, and uniform laws were  established throughout the empire.

The grand error, as has already been said, of the Graeco-Roman or  gentile civilization, was in its denial or ignorance of the unity  of the human race, as well as the Unity of God, and in its  including in the state only a particular class of the territorial  people, while it held all the rest as slaves, though in different  degrees of servitude.  It recognized and sustained a privileged  class, a ruling order; and if, as subsequently did the Venetian  aristocracy, it recognized democratic equality within that order,  it held all outside of it to be less than men and without  political rights.  Practically, power was an attribute of birth  and of private wealth.  Suffrage was almost universal among  freemen, but down almost to the Empire, the people voted by  orders, and were counted, not numerically, but by the rank of the  order, and the comitia curiata could always carry the election  over the comitia centuriata, and thus power remained always in  the hands of the rich and noble few.

The Roman Law, as digested by jurists under 397                                             Justinian in the  sixth Century, indeed, recognizes the unity of the race, asserts  the equality of all men by the natural law, and undertakes to  defend slavery on principles not incompatible with that equality.   It represents it as a commutation of the punishment of death,  which the emperor has the right to inflict on captives taken in  war, to perpetual servitude; and as servitude is less severe than  death, slavery was really a proof of imperial clemency.  But it  has never yet been proved that the emperor has the right under  the natural law to put captives taken even in a just war to  death, and the Roman poet himself bids us "humble the proud, but  spare the submissive."  In a just war the emperor may kill on the  battle-field those in arms against him, but the jus gentium, as  now interpreted by the jurisprudence of every civilized nation,  does not allow him to put them to death after they have ceased  resistance, have thrown down their arms, and surrendered.  But  even if it did, it gives him a right only over the persons  captured, not over their innocent children, and therefore no  right to establish hereditary slavery, for the child is not  punishable for the offences of the parent.  The law, indeed,  assumed that the captive ceased to exist as a person and treated  him as a thing, or mere property 398                                  of the conqueror, and being  property, he could beget only property, which would accrue only  to his owner.  But there is no power in heaven or earth that can  make a person a thing, a mere piece of merchandise, and it is  only by a clumsy fiction, or rather by a bare-faced lie, that the  law denies the slave his personality and treats him as a thing.   I the unity of all men had been clearly seen and vividly felt,  the law would never have attempted to justify perpetual slavery  on the ground of its penal character, or indeed on any ground  whatever.  All men are born under the law of nature with equal  rights, and the civil law can justly deprive no man of his  liberty, but for a crime, committed by him personally, that  justly forfeits his liberty to society.

These defects of the Graeco-Roman civilization the European  nations have in part remedied, and may completely remedy.  They  can carry out practically the Christian dogma of the unity of the  human race, abolish slavery in every form, make all men equal  before the law, and the political people commensurate with the  territorial people.  Indeed, France has already done it.  She has  abolished slavery, villenage, serfage, political aristocracy,  asserted the equality of all men before the law, vindicated the 399 sovereignty of the people, and established universal suffrage,  complete social and territorial democracy.  The other nations may  do as much, but hardly can any of them do more or advance  farther.  Yet in France, territorial democracy the most complete  results only in establishing the most complete imperial  centralism, usually called Caesarism.

The imperial constitution of France recognizes that the emperor  reigns "by the grace of God and the will of the nation," and  therefore, that by the grace of God and the will of the nation he  may cease to reign; but while he reigns he is supreme, and his  will is law.  The constitution imposes no real or effective  restraint on his power: while he sits upon the throne he is  practically France, and the ministers are his clerks; the council  of state, the senate, and the legislative body are merely his  agents in governing the nation.  This may, indeed, be changed,  but only to substitute for imperial centralism democratic  centralism, which were no improvement, or to go back to the  system of antagonisms, checks and balances, called  constitutionalism, or parliamentary government, of which Great  Britain is the model, and which were a return toward barbarism,  or mediaeval feudalism.

400 The human race has its life in God, and tends to realize in all  orders the Divine Word or Logos, which is Ionic itself, and the  principle of all conciliation, of the dialectic union of all  opposites or extremes.  Mankind will be logical; and the worst of  all tyrannies is that which forbids them to draw from their  principles their last logical consequences, or that prohibits  them the free explication and application of the Divine Idea, in  which consists their life, their progress.  Such tyranny strikes  at the very existence of society, and wars against the reality of  things.  It is supremely sophistical, and its success is death;  for the universe in its constitution is supremely logical, and  man, individually and socially, is rational.  God is the author  and type of all created things; and all creatures, each in its  order, imitate or copies the Divine Being, who is intrinsically  Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, principle, medium, and end.  The Son  or Word is the medium, which unites the two extremes, whence God  is living God a real, active, living Being--living, concrete, not  abstract or dead unity, like the unity of old Xenophanes,  Plotinus, and Proclus.  In the Holy Trinity is the principle and  prototype of all society, and what is called the solidarity of  the race is only the outward 401                              expression, or copy in the external  order, of what theologians term the circumsession of the three  Divine Persons of the Godhead.

Now, human society, when it copies the Divine essence and nature  either in the distinction of persons alone, or in the unity  alone, is sophistical, and wants the principle of all life and  reality.  It sins against God. and must fail of its end.  The  English system, which is based on antagonistic elements, on  opposites, without the middle term that conciliates them, unites  them, and makes them dialectically one, copies the Divine model  in its distinctions alone, which, considered alone, are opposites  or contraries.  It denies, if Englishmen could but see it, the  unity of God.  The French, or imperial system, which excludes the  extremes, instead of uniting them, denies all opposites, instead  of conciliating them--denies the distinctions in the model, and  copies only the unity, which is the supreme sophism called  pantheism.  The English constitution has no middle term, and the  French no extremes, and each in its way denies the Divine  Trinity, the original basis and type of the syllogism.  The human  race can be contented with neither, for neither allows it free  scope for its inherent life and activity.  The English system  tends to pure individualism; 402 the French to pure socialism or despotism, each endeavoring to  suppress an element of the one living and indissoluble TRUTH.

This is not fancy, is not fine-spun speculation, or cold and  lifeless abstraction, but the highest theological and  philosophical truth, without which there were no reason, no man,  no society; for God is the first principle of all being, all  existence, all science, all life, and it is in Him that we live  and move and have our being.  God is at the beginning, in the  middle, and at the end of all things--the universal principle,  medium, and end; and no truth can be denied without His existence  being directly or indirectly impugned.  In a deeper sense than is  commonly understood is it true that nisi Dominus aedificaverit  domum, in vanum laboraverunt qui aedificant eam.  The English  constitution is composed of contradictory elements, incapable of  reconciliation, and each element is perpetually struggling with  the others for the mastery.  For a long time the king labored,  intrigued, and fought to free himself from the thraldom in which  he was held by the feudal barons; in 1688 the aristocracy and  people united and humbled the crown; and now the people are at  work seeking to sap both the crown and the nobles.  The state is  consti- 403       tuted to nobody's satisfaction; and though all may unite in  boasting its excellences, all are at work trying to alter or  amend it.  The work of constituting the state with the English is  ever beginning, never ending.  Hence the eternal clamor for  parliamentary reform.

Great Britain and other European states may sweep away all that  remains of feudalism, include the whole territorial people with  the equal rights of all in the state or political people, concede  to birth and wealth no political rights, but they will by so  doing only establish either imperial centralism, as has been done  in France, or democratic centralism, clamored for, conspired for,  and fought for by the revolutionists of Europe.  The special  merit of the American system is not in its democracy alone, as  too many at home and abroad imagine; but along with its democracy  in the division of the powers of government, between a General  government and particular State governments, which are not  antagonistic governments, for they act on different matters, and  neither is nor can be subordinated to the other.

Now, this division of power, which decentralizes the government  without creating mutually hostile forces, can hardly be  introduced into any European state.  There may be a 404                                                     union of  states in Great Britain, in Germany, in Italy, perhaps in Spain,  and Austria is laboring hard to effect it in her heterogeneous  empire; but the union possible in any of them is that of a Bund  or confederation, like the Swiss or German Bund, similar to what  the secessionists in the United States so recently attempted and  have so signally failed to establish.  An intelligent Confederate  officer remarked that their Confederacy had not been in operation  three months before it became evident that the principle on  which it was founded, if not rejected, would insure its defeat.   It was that principle of State sovereignty, for which the States  seceded, more than the superior resources and numbers of the  Government, that caused the collapse of the Confederacy.  The  numbers were relatively about equal, and the military resources  of the Confederacy were relatively not much inferior to those of  the Government.  So at least the Confederate leaders thought, and  they knew the material resources of the Government as well as  their own, and had calculated them with as much care and accuracy  as any men could.  Foreign powers also, friendly as well as  unfriendly, felt certain that the secessionists would gain their  independence, and so did a large part of the people even of the  loyal States. 405                The failure is due to the disintegrating principle  of State sovereignty, the very principle of the Confederacy.  The  war has proved that united states are, other things being equal,  an overmatch for confederated states.

The European states must unite either as equals or as unequals.   As equals, the union can be only a confederacy, a sort of  Zollverein, in which each state retains its individual  sovereignty; if as unequals, then someone among them will aspire  to the hegemony, and you have over again the Athenian  Confederation, formed at the conclusion of the Persian war, and  its fate.  A union like the American cannot be created by a  compact, or by the exercise of supreme power.  The Emperor of the  French cannot erect the several Departments of France into  states, and divide the powers of government between them as  individual and as united states.  They would necessarily hold  from the imperial government, which, though it might exercise a  large part of its functions through them, would remain, as now,  the supreme central government, from which all governmental  powers emanate, as our President is apparently attempting, in his  reconstruction policy, to make the government of the United  States.  The elements of a state constituted like the American 406                                                                do  not exist in any European nation, nor in the constitution of  European society; and the American constitution would have been  impracticable even here had not Providence so ordered it that the  nation was born with it, and has never known any other.

Rome recognized the necessity of the federal principle, and  applied it in the best way she could.  At first it was a single  tribe or people distributed into distinct gentes or houses; after  the Sabine war, a second tribe was added on terms of equality,  and the state was dual, composed of two tribes, the Ramnes and  the Tities or Quirites, and, afterward, in the time of Tullus  Hostilius, were added the Lucertes or Luceres, making the  division into three ruling tribes, each divided into one hundred  houses or gentes.  Each house in each tribe was represented by  its chief or decurion in the senate, making the number of  senators exactly three hundred, at which number the senate was  fixed.  Subsequently was added, by Ancus, the plebs, who remained  without authority or share in the government of the city of Rome  itself, though they might aspire to the first rank in the allied  cities.  The division into tribes, and the division of the tribes  into gentes or houses, and the vote in the state by tribes, and  in the tribes by houses, ef- 407                            fectually excluded democratic  centralism; but the division was not a division of the powers of  government between two co-ordinate governments, for the senate  had supreme control, like the British parliament, over all  matters, general and particular.

The establishment, after the secession of the plebs, of the  tribunitial veto, which gave the plebeians a negative power in  the state, there was an incipient division of the powers of  government; but only a division between the positive and negative  powers, not between the general and the particular.  The power  accorded to the plebs, or commons, as Niebuhr calls them--who is,  perhaps, too fond of explaining the early constitution of Rome by  analogies borrowed from feudalism, and especially from the  constitution of his native Ditmarsch--was simply an obstructive  power; and when it, by development, became a positive power, it  absorbed all the powers of government, and created the Empire.

There was, indeed, a nearer approach to the division of powers in  the American system, between imperial Rome and her allied or  confederated municipalities.  These municipalities, modelled  chiefly after that of Rome, were elective, and had the management  of their own local affairs; but their local powers were not  co-ordi- 408        inate in their own sphere with those exercised by the  Roman municipality, but subordinate and dependent.  The senate  had the supreme power over them, and they held their rights  subject to its will.  They were formally, or virtually,  subjugated states, to which the Roman senate, and afterward the  Roman emperors, left the form of the state and the mere shadow of  freedom.  Rome owed much to her affecting to treat them as allies  rather than as subjects, and at first these municipal  organizations secured the progress of civilization in the  provinces; but at a later period, under the emperors, they served  only the imperial treasury, and were crushed by the taxes imposed  and the contributions levied on them by the fiscal agents of the  empire.  So heavy were the fiscal burdens imposed on the  burgesses, if the term may be used, that it needed an imperial  edict to compel them to enter the municipal government; and it  became, under the later emperors, no uncommon thing for free  citizens to sell themselves into slavery, to escape the fiscal  burdens imposed.  There are actually imperial edicts extant  forbidden freemen to sell themselves as slaves.  Thus ended the  Roman federative system, and it is difficult to discover in  Europe the elements of a federative system that could have a  more favorable result.

409 Now, the political destiny or mission of the United States is, in  common with the European nations, to eliminate the barbaric  elements retained by the Roman constitution, and specially to  realize that philosophical division of the powers of government  which distinguish it from both imperial and democratic centralism  on the one hand, and, on the other, from the checks and balances  or organized antagonisms which seek to preserve liberty by  obstructing the exercise of power.  No greater problem in  statesmanship remains to be solved, and no greater contribution  to civilization to be made.  Nowhere else than in this New World,  and in this New World only in the United States, can this problem  be solved, or this contribution be made, and what the  Graeco-Roman republic began be completed.

But the United States have a religious as well as a political  destiny, for religion and politics go together.  Church and  state, as governments, are separate indeed, but the principles on  which the state is founded have their origin and ground in the  spiritual order--in the principles revealed or affirmed by  religion--and are inseparable from them.  There is no state  without God, any more than there is a church without Christ or  the Incarnation.  An atheist may be a politician, but if there  were 410      no God there could be no politics. theological principles  are the basis of political principles.  The created universe is a  dialectic whole, distinct but inseparable from its Creator, and  all its parts cohere and are essential to one another.  All has  its origin and prototype in the Triune God, and throughout  expresses unity in triplicity and triplicity in unity, without  which there is no real being and no actual or possible life.   Every thing has its principle, medium, and end.  Natural society  is initial, civil government is medial, the church is  teleological, but the three are only distinctions in one  indissoluble whole.

Man, as we have seen, lives by communion with God through the  Divine creative act, and is perfected or completed only through  the Incarnation, in Christ, the Word made flesh.  True, he  communes with God through his kind, and through external nature,  society in which he is born and reared, and property through  which he derives sustenance for his body; but these are only  media of his communion with God, the source of life--not either  the beginning or the end of his communion.  They have no life in  themselves, since their being is in God, and, of themselves, can  impart none.  They are in the order of second causes, and second 411 causes, without the first cause, are nought.  Communion which  stops with them, which takes them as the principle and end,  instead of media, as they are, is the communion of death, not of  life.  As religion includes all that relates to communion with  God, it must in some form be inseparable from every living act of  man, both individually and socially; and, in the long run, men  must conform either their politics to their religion or their  religion to their politics.  Christianity is constantly at work,  moulding political society in its own image and likeness, and  every political system struggles to harmonize Christianity with  itself.  If, then, the United States have a political destiny,  they have a religious destiny inseparable from it.

The political destiny of the United States is to conform the  state to the order of reality, or, so to speak, to the Divine  Idea in creation.  Their religious destiny is to render  practicable and to realize the normal relations between church  and state, religion and politics, as concreted in the life of the  nation.

In politics, the United States are not realizing a political  theory of any sort whatever.  They, on the contrary, are  successfully refuting all political theories, making away with  them, and establishing the state--not on a theory, not 412                                                        on an  artificial basis or a foundation laid by human reason or will,  but on reality, the eternal and immutable principles in relation  to which man is created.  They are doing the same in regard to  religious theories.  Religion is not a theory, a subjective view,  an opinion, but is, objectively, at once a principle, a law, and  a fact, and, subjectively, it is, by the aid of God's grace,  practical conformity to what is universally true and real.  The  United States, in fulfilment of their destiny, are making as sad  havoc with religious theories as with political theories, and are  pressing on with irresistible force to the real or the Divine  order which is expressed in the Christian mysteries, which exists  independent of man's understanding and will, and which man can  neither make nor unmake.

The religious destiny of the United States is not to create a new  religion nor to found a new church.  All real religion is  catholic, and is neither new nor old, but is always and  everywhere true.  Even our Lord came neither to found a new  church nor to create a new religion, but to do the things which  had been foretold, and to fulfil in time what had been determined  in eternity.  God has himself founded the church on catholic  principles, or principles al- 413                             ways and everywhere real principles.   His church is necessarily catholic, because founded on catholic  dogmas, and the dogmas are catholic, because they are universal  and immutable principles, having their origin and ground in the  Divine Being Himself, or in the creative act by which He produces  and sustains all things.  Founded on universal and immutable  principles, the church can never grow old or obsolete, but is the  church for all times and Places, for all ranks and conditions of  men.  Man cannot change either the church or the dogmas of faith,  for they are founded in the highest reality, which is above him,  over him, and independent of him.  Religion is above and  independent of the state, and the state has nothing to do with  the church or her dogmas, but to accept and conform to them as it  does to any of the facts or principles of science, to a  mathematical truth, or to a physical law.

But while the church, with her essential constitution, and her  dogmas are founded in the Divine order, and are catholic and  unalterable, the relations between the civil and ecclesiastical  authorities may be changed or modified by the changes of time and  place.  These relations have not been always the same, but have  dif- 414    fered in different ages and countries.  During the first three  centuries of our era the church had no legal status, and was  either connived at or persecuted by the state.  Under the  Christian emperors she was recognized by the civil law; her  prelates had exclusive jurisdiction in mixed civil and  ecclesiastical questions, and were made, in some sense, civil  magistrates, and paid as such by the empire.  Under feudalism,  the prelates received investiture as princes and barons, and  formed alone, or in connection with the temporal lords, an estate  in the kingdom.  The Pope became a temporal prince and suzerain,  at one time, of a large part of Europe, and exercised the  arbitratorship in all grave questions between Christian  sovereigns themselves, and between them and their subjects.   Since the downfall of feudalism and the establishment of modern  centralized monarchy, the church has been robbed of the greater  part of her temporal possessions, and deprived, in most  countries, of all civil functions, and treated by the state  either as an enemy or as a slave.

In all the sectarian and schismatic states of the Old World, the  national church is held in strict subjection to the civil  authority, as in Great Britain and Russia, and is the slave of 415 the state; in the other states of Europe, as France, Austria,  Spain, and Italy, she is treated with distrust by the civil  government, and allowed hardly a shadow of freedom and  independence.  In France, which has the proud title of eldest  daughter of the church, Catholics, as such, are not freer than  they are in Turkey.  All religious are said to be free, and all  are free, except the religion of the majority of Frenchmen.  The  emperor, because nominally a Catholic, takes it upon himself to  concede the church just as much and just as little freedom in the  empire as he judges expedient for his own secular interests.  In  Italy, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, and the Central and South  American states, the policy of the civil authorities is the same,  or worse.  It may be safely asserted that, except in the United  States, the church is either held by the civil power in  subjection, or treated as an enemy.  The relation is not that of  union and harmony, but that of antagonism, to the grave detriment  of both religion and civilization.

It is impossible, even if it were desirable, to restore the  mixture of civil and ecclesiastical governments which obtained in  the Middle Ages; and a total separation of church and state, even  as corporations, would, in the pres- 416                                    ent state of men's minds in  Europe, be construed, if approved by the church, into a sanction  by her of political atheism, or the right of the civil power to  govern according to its own will and pleasure in utter disregard  of the law of God, the moral order, or the immutable distinctions  between right and wrong.  It could only favor the absolutism of  the state, and put the temporal in the place of the spiritual.   Hence, the Holy Father includes the proposition of the entire  separation of church and state in the Syllabus of Errors  condemned in his Encyclical, dated at Rome, December 8, 1864.   Neither the state nor the people, elsewhere than in the United  States, can understand practically such separation in any other  sense than the complete emancipation of our entire secular life  from the law of God, or the Divine order, which is the real  order.  It is not the union of church and state--that is, the  union, or identity rather, of religious and political  principles--that it is desirable to get rid of, but the disunion  or antagonism of church and state.  But this is nowhere possible  out of the United States; for nowhere else is the state organized  on catholic principles, or capable of acting, when acting from  its own constitution, in harmony with a really catholic church,  or the religious order 417                        really existing, in relation to which all  things are created and governed.  Nowhere else is it practicable,  at present, to maintain between the two powers their normal  relations.

But what is not practicable in the Old World is perfectly  practicable in the New.  The state here being organized in  accordance with catholic principles, there can be no antagonism  between it and the church.  Though operating in different  spheres, both are, in their respective spheres, developing and  applying to practical life the one and the same Divine Idea.  The  church can trust the state, and the state can trust the church.   Both act from the same principle to one and the same end.  Each  by its own constitution co-operates with, aids, and completes the  other.  It is true the church is not formally established as the  civil law of the land, nor is it necessary that she should be;  because there is nothing in the state that conflicts with her  freedom and independence, with her dogmas or her irreformable  canons.  The need of establishing the church by law, and  protecting her by legal pains and penalties, as is still done in  most countries, can exist only in a barbarous or semi-barbarous  state of society, where the state is not organized on catholic  principles, or the civilization is based on false  418                                                   principles, and  in its development tends not to the real or Divine order of  things.  When the state is constituted in harmony with that  order, it is carried onward by the force of its own internal  constitution in a catholic direction, and a church establishment,  or what is called a state religion, would be an anomaly, or a  superfluity.  The true religion is in the heart of the state, as  its informing principle and real interior life.  The external  establishment, by legal enactment of the church, would afford her  no additional protection, add nothing to her power and efficacy,  and effect nothing for faith or piety--neither of which can be  forced, because both must, from their nature, be free-will  offerings to God.

In the United States, false religions are legally as free as the  true religion; but all false religions being one-sided,  sophistical, and uncatholic, are opposed by the principles of the  state, which tend, by their silent but effective workings, to  eliminate them.  The American state recognizes only the catholic  religion.  It eschews all sectarianism, and none of the sects  have been able to get their peculiarities incorporated into its  constitution or its laws.  The state conforms to what each holds  that is catholic, that is always and everywhere religion; and  what 419      ever is not catholic it leaves, as outside of its province,  to live or die, according to its own inherent vitality or want of  vitality.  The state conscience is catholic, not sectarian; hence  it is that the utmost freedom can be allowed to all religions,  the false as well as the true; for the state, being catholic in  its constitution, can never suffer the adherents of the false to  oppress the consciences of the adherents of the true.  The church  being free, and the state harmonizing with her, catholicity has,  in the freedom of both, all the protection it needs, all the  security it can ask, and all the support it can, in the nature of  the case receive from external institutions, or from social and  political organizations.

This freedom may not be universally wise or prudent, for all  nations may not be prepared for it: all may not have attained  their majority.  The church, as well as the state, must deal with  men and nations as they are, not as they are not.  To deal with a  child as with an adult, or with a barbarous nation as with a  civilized nation, would be only acting a lie.  The church cannot  treat men as free men where they are not free men, nor appeal to  reason in those in whom reason is undeveloped.  She must adapt  her discipline to the age, condition, and culture of individuals,  and 420     to the greater or less progress of nations in civilization.   She herself remains always the same in her constitution, her  authority, and her faith; but varies her discipline with the  variations of time and place.  Many of her canons, very proper  and necessary in one age, cease to be so in another, and many  which are needed in the Old World would be out of place in the  New World.  Under the American system, she can deal with the  people as free men, and trust them as freemen, because free men  they are.  The freeman asks, why? and the reason why must be  given him, or his obedience fails to be secured.  The simple  reason that the church commands will rarely satisfy him; he would  know why she commands this or that.  The full-grown free man  revolts at blind obedience, and he regards all obedience as in  some measure blind for which he sees only an extrinsic command.   Blind obedience even to the authority of the church cannot be  expected of the people reared under the American system, not  because they are filled with the spirit of disobedience, but  because they insist that obedience shall be rationabile  obsequium, an act of the understanding, not of the will or the  affections alone.  They are trained to demand a reason for the  command given them, to dis- 421                           tinguish between the law and the person  of the magistrate.  They can obey God, but not man, and they must  see that the command given has its reason in the Divine order, or  the intrinsic catholic reason of things, or they will not yield  it a full, entire, and hearty obedience.  The reason that  suffices for the child does not suffice for the adult, and the  reason that suffices for barbarians does not suffice for civilized  men, or that suffices for nations in the infancy of their  civilization does not suffice for them in its maturity.  The  appeal to external authority was much less frequent under the  Roman Empire than in the barbarous ages that followed its  downfall, when the church became mixed up with the state.

This trait of the American character is not uncatholic.  An  intelligent, free, willing obedience, yielded from personal  conviction, after seeing its reasonableness, its justice, its  logic in the Divine order--the obedience of a free man, not of a  slave--is far more consonant to the spirit of the church, and far  more acceptable to God, than simple, blind obedience; and a  people capable of yielding it stand far higher in the scale of  civilization than the people that must be governed as children or  barbarians.  It is possible that the people of the Old World 422                                                              are  not prepared for the regimen of freedom in religion any more than  they are prepared for freedom in politics; for they have been  trained only to obey external authority, and are not accustomed  to look on religion as having its reason in the real order, or in  the reason of things.  They understand no reason for obedience  beyond the external command, and do not believe it possible to  give or to understand the reason why the command itself is given.   They regard the authority of the church as a thing apart, and see  no way by which faith and reason can be harmonized.  They look  upon them as antagonistic forces rather than as integral elements  of one and the same whole.  Concede them the regimen of freedom,  and their religion has no support but in their good-will, their  affections, their associations, their habits, and their  prejudices.  It has no root in their rational convictions, and  when they begin to reason they begin to doubt.  This is not the  state of things that is desirable, but it cannot be remedied  under the political regime established elsewhere than in the  United States.  In every state in the world, except the American,  the civil constitution is sophistical, and violates, more or  less, the logic of things; and, therefore, in no one of them can  the peo- 423        ple receive a thoroughly dialectic training, or an  education in strict conformity to the real order.  Hence, in them  all, the church is more or less obstructed in her operations, and  prevented from carrying out in its fulness her own Divine Idea.   She does the best she can in the circumstances and with the  materials with which she is supplied, and exerts herself  continually to bring individuals and nations into harmony with  her Divine law: but still her life in the midst of the nations is  a struggle, a warfare.

The United States being dialectically constituted, and founded on  real catholic, not sectarian or sophistical principles, presents  none of these obstacles, and must, in their progressive  development or realization of their political idea, put an end to  this warfare, in so far as a warfare between church and state,  and leave the church in her normal position in society, in which  she can, without let or hindrance, exert her free spirit, and  teach and govern men by the Divine law as free men.  She may  encounter unbelief, misbelief, ignorance, and indifference in  few, or in many; but these, deriving no support from the state,  which tends constantly to eliminate them, must gradually give way  before her invincible logic, her divine charity, the 424                                                      truth and  reality of things, and the intelligence, activity, and zeal of  her ministers.  The American people are, on the surface,  sectarians or indifferentists; but they are, in reality, less  uncatholic than the people of any other country because they are,  in their intellectual and moral development, nearer to the real  order, or, in the higher and broader sense of the word more truly  civilized.  The multitude of sects that obtain may excite  religious compassion for those who are carried away by them, for  men can be saved or attain to their eternal destiny only by  truth, or conformity to Him who said, "I am the way, the truth,  and the life;" but in relation to the national destiny they need  excite no alarm, no uneasiness, for underlying them all is more  or less of catholic truth, and the vital forces of the national  life repel them, in so far as they are sectarian and not  catholic, as substances that cannot be assimilated to the  national life.  The American state being catholic in its organic  principles, as is all real religion, and the church being free,  whatever is anticatholic, or uncatholic, is without any support  in either, and having none, either in reality or in itself, it  must necessarily fall and gradually disappear.

The sects themselves have a half unavowed 425                                           conviction that they  cannot subsist forever as sects, if unsupported by the civil  authority.  They are free, but do not feel safe in the United  States.  They know the real church is catholic, and that they  themselves are none of them catholic.  The most daring among them  even pretends to be no more than a "branch" of the catholic  church.  They know that only the catholic church can withstand  the pressure of events and survive the shocks of time, and hence  everywhere their movements to get rid of their sectarianism and  to gain a catholic character.  They hold conventions of delegates  from the whole sectarian world, form "unions," "alliances," and  "associations;" but, unhappily for their success, the catholic  church does not originate in convention, but is founded by the  Word made flesh, and sustained by the indwelling Holy Ghost.  The  most they can do, even with the best dispositions in the world,  is to create a confederation, and confederated sects are  something very different from a church inherently one and  catholic.  It is no more the catholic church than the late  Southern Confederacy was the American state.  The sectarian  combinations may do some harm, may injure many souls, and retard,  for a time, the progress of civilization; but in a state  organized in ac- 426                cordance with catholic principles, and left to  themselves, they are powerless against the national destiny, and  must soon wither and die as branches severed from the vine.

Such being the case, no sensible Catholic can imagine that the  church needs any physical force against the sects, except to  repel actual violence, and protect her in that freedom of speech  and possession which is the right of all before the state.  What  are called religious establishments are needed only where either  the state is barbarous or the religion is sectarian.  Where the  state, in its intrinsic constitution, is in accordance with  catholic principles, as in the United States, the church has all  she needs or can receive.  The state can add nothing more to her  power or her security in her moral and spiritual warfare with  sectarianism, and any attempt to give her more would only weaken  her as against the sects, place her in a false light, partially  justify their hostility to her, render effective their  declamations against her, mix her up unnecessarily with political  changes, interests, and passions, and distract the attention of  her ministers from their proper work as churchmen, and impose on  them the duties of politicians and statesmen.  Where there is  nothing in the state hostile to the church, 427                                             where she is free to  act according to her own constitution and laws, and exercise her  own discipline on her own spiritual subjects, civil enactments in  her favor or against the sects may embarrass or impede her  operations, but cannot aid her, for she can advance no farther  than she wins the heart and convinces the understanding.  A  spiritual work can, in the nature of things, be effected only by  spiritual means.  The church wants freedom in relation to the  state--nothing more; for all her power comes immediately from  God, without any intervention or mediation of the state.

The United States, constituted in accordance with the real order  of things, and founded on principles which have their origin and  ground in the principles on which the church herself is founded,  can never establish any one of the sects as the religion of the  state, for that would violate their political constitution, and  array all the other sects, as well as the church herself, against  the government.  They cannot be called upon to establish the  church by law, because she is already in their constitution as  far as the state has in itself any relation with religion, and  because to establish her in any other sense would be to make her  one of the civil institutions of the, 428                                       land, and to bring her  under the control of the state, which were equally against her  interest and her nature.

The religious mission of the United States is not then to  establish the church by external law, or to protect her by legal  disabilities, pains, and penalties against the sects, however  uncatholic they may be; but to maintain catholic freedom, neither  absorbing the state in the church nor the church in the state,  but leaving each to move freely, according to its own nature, in  the sphere assigned it in the eternal order of things.  Their  mission separates church and state as external governing bodies,  but unites them in the interior principles from which each  derives its vitality and force.  Their union is in the intrinsic  unity of principle, and in the fact that, though moving in  different spheres, each obeys one and the same Divine law.  With  this the Catholic, who knows what Catholicity means, is of course  satisfied, for it gives the church all the advantage over the  sects of the real over the unreal; and with this the sects have  no right to be dissatisfied, for it subjects them to no  disadvantage not inherent in sectarianism itself in presence of  Catholicity, and without any support from the civil authority.

The effect of this mission of our country fully 429                                                 realized, would  be to harmonize church and state, religion and politics, not by  absorbing either in the other, or by obliterating the natural  distinction between them, but by conforming both to the real or  Divine order, which is supreme and immutable.  It places the two  powers in their normal relation, which has hitherto never been  done, because hitherto there never has been a state normally  constituted.  The nearest approach made to the realization of the  proper relations of church and state, prior to the birth of the  American Republic, was in the Roman Empire under the Christian  emperors; but the state had been perverted by paganism, and the  emperors, inheriting the old pontifical power, could never be  made to understand their own incompetency in spirituals, and  persisted to the last in treating the church as a civil  institution under their supervision and control, as does the  Emperor of the French in France, even yet.  In the Middle Ages  the state was so barbarously constituted that the church was  obliged to supervise its administration, to mix herself up with  the civil government, in order to infuse some intelligence into  civil matters, and to preserve her own rightful freedom and  independence.  When the states broke away from feudalism, they  revived the Roman 430                   constitution, and claimed the authority in  ecclesiastical matters that had been exercised by the Roman  Caesars, and the states that adopted a sectarian religion gave  the sect adopted a civil establishment, and subjected it to the  civil government, to which the sect not unwillingly consented,  on condition that the civil authority excluded the church and all  other sects, and made it the exclusive religion of the state, as  in England, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, and the states of  Northern Germany.  Even yet the normal relations of church and  state are nowhere practicable in the Old World; for everywhere  either the state is more or less barbaric in its constitution, or  the religion is sectarian, and the church as well as civilization  is obliged, to struggle with antagonistic forces, for  self-preservation.

There are formidable parties all over Europe at work to introduce  what they take to be the American system; but constitutions are  generated, not made--providential, not conventional.  Statesmen  can only develop what is in the existing constitutions of their  respective countries, and no European constitution contains all  the elements of the American.  European Liberals mistake the  American system, and, were they to succeed in their efforts,  would not in- 431             troduce it, but something more hostile to it than the  governments and institutions they are warring against.  They  start from narrow, sectarian, or infidel premises, and seek not  freedom of worship, but freedom of denial.  They suppress the  freedom of religion as the means of securing what they call  religious liberty--imagine that they secure freedom of thought by  extinguishing the light without which no thought is possible, and  advance civilization by undermining its foundation.  The  condemnation of their views and movements by the Holy Father in  the Encyclical, which has excited so much hostility, may seem to  superficial and unthinking Americans even, as a condemnation of  our American system--indeed, as the condemnation of modern  science, intelligence, and civilization itself; but whoever looks  below the surface, has some insight into the course of events,  understands the propositions and movements censured, and the  sense in which they are censured, is well assured that the Holy  Father has simply exercised his pastoral and teaching authority  to save religion, society, science, and civilization from utter  corruption or destruction.  The opinions, tendencies, and  movements, directly or by implication censured, are the effect of  narrow and superficial think- 432                             ing, of partial and one-sided views,  and are sectarian, sophistical, and hostile to all real progress,  and tend, as far as they go, to throw society back into the  barbarism from which, after centuries of toil and struggle, it is  just beginning to emerge.  The Holy Father has condemned nothing  that real philosophy, real science does not also condemn;  nothing, in fact, that is not at war with the American system  itself.  For the mass of the people, it were desirable that  fuller explanations should be given of the sense in which the  various propositions censured are condemned, for some of them are  not, in every sense, false; but the explanations needed were  expected by the Holy Father to be given by the bishops and  prelates, to whom, not to the people, save through them, the  Encyclical was addressed.  Little is to be hoped, and much is to  be feared, for liberty, science, and civilization from European  Liberalism, which has no real affinity with American territorial  democracy and real civil and religious freedom.  But God and  reality are present in the Old World as, well as in the New, and  it will never do to restrict their power or freedom.

Whether the American people will prove faithful to their mission,  and realize their destiny, or not, is known only to Him from whom 433 nothing is hidden.  Providence is free, and leaves always a space  for human free-will.  The American people can fail, and will fail  if they neglect the appointed means and conditions of success;  but there is nothing in their present state or in their past  history to render their failure probable.  They have in their  internal constitution what Rome wanted, and they are in no danger  of being crushed by exterior barbarism.  Their success as feeble  colonies of Great Britain in achieving their national  independence, and especially in maintaining, unaided, and against  the real hostility of Great Britain and France, their national  unity and integrity against a rebellion which, probably, no other  people could have survived, gives reasonable assurance for their  future.  The leaders of the rebellion, than whom none better knew  or more nicely calculated the strength and resources of the  Union, counted with certainty on success, and the ablest, the  most experienced, and best informed statesmen of the Old World  felt sure that the Republic was gone, and spoke of it as the late  United States.  Not a few, even in the loyal States, who had no  sympathy with the rebellion, believed it idle to think of  suppressing it by force, and advised peace on the best terms that  could be obtained.  But Ilium fuit 434                                    was chanted too soon; the  American people were equal to the emergency, and falsified the  calculations and predictions of their enemies, and surpassed the  expectations of their friends.

The attitude of the real American people during the fearful  struggle affords additional confidence in their destiny.  With  larger armies on foot than Napoleon ever commanded, with their  line of battle stretching from ocean to ocean, across the whole  breadth of the continent, they never, during four long years of  alternate victories and defeats--and both unprecedentedly  bloody--for a moment lost their equanimity, or appeared less  calm, collected, tranquil, than in the ordinary times of peace.   They not for a moment interrupted their ordinary routine of  business or pleasure, or seemed conscious of being engaged in any  serious struggle which required an effort.  There was no hurry,  no bustle, no excitement, no fear, no misgiving.  They seemed to  regard the war as a mere bagatelle, not worth being in earnest  about.  The on-looker was almost angry with their apparent  indifference, apparent insensibility, and doubted if they moved  at all, Yet move they did: guided by an unerring instinct, they  moved quietly on with an elemental force, in spite of a timid and  hesitating administration, in spite of inexpe- 435                                              rienced,  over-cautious, incompetent, or blundering military commanders,  whom they gently brushed aside, and desisted not till their  object was gained, and they saw the flag of the Union floating  anew in the breeze from the capitol of every State that dared  secede.  No man could contemplate them without feeling that there  was in them a latent power vastly superior to any which they  judged it necessary to put forth.  Their success proves to all  that what, prior to the war, was treated as American arrogance or  self-conceit, was only the outspoken confidence in their destiny  as a Providential people, conscious that to them is reserved the  hegemony of the world.

Count de Maistre predicted early in the century the failure of  the United States, because they have no proper name; but his  prediction assumed what is not the fact.  The United States have  a proper name by which all the world knows and calls them.  The  proper name of the country is America: that of the people is  Americans.  Speak of Americans simply, and nobody understands you  to mean the people of Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile,  Paraguay, but everybody understands you to mean the people of the  United States.  The fact is significant, and foretells for the  people of the United States a 436                               continental destiny, as is also  foreshadowed in the so-called "Monroe doctrine," which France,  during our domestic troubles, was permitted, on condition of not  intervening in our civil war in favor of the rebellion, to  violate.

There was no statesmanship in proclaiming the "Monroe doctrine,"  for the statesman keeps always, as far as possible, his  government free to act according to the exigencies of the case  when it comes up, unembarrassed by previous declarations of  principles.  Yet the doctrine only expresses the destiny of the  American people, and which nothing but their own fault can  prevent them from realizing in its own good time.  Napoleon will  not succeed in his Mexican policy, and Mexico will add some  fifteen or twenty new States to the American Union as soon as it  is clearly for the interests of all parties that it should be  done, and it can be done by mutual consent, without war or  violence.  The Union will fight to maintain the integrity of her  domain and the supremacy of her laws within it, but she can  never, consistently with her principles or her interests, enter  upon a career of war and conquest.  Her system is violated,  endangered, not extended, by subjugating her neighbors, for  subjugation and liberty go not together.  Annexation, when it 437 takes place, must be on terms of perfect equality and by the free  act of the state annexed.  The Union can admit of no inequality  of rights and franchises between the States of which it is  composed.  The Canadian Provinces and the Mexican and Central  American States, when annexed, must be as free as the original  States of the Union, sharing alike in the power and the  protection of the Republic--alike in its authority, its freedom,  its grandeur, and its glory, as one free, independent,  self-governing people.  They may gain much, but must lose nothing  by annexation.

The Emperor Napoleon and his very respectable protege,  Maximilian, an able man and a liberal-minded prince, can change  nothing in the destiny of the United States, or of Mexico  herself; no imperial government can be permanent beside the  American Republic, no longer liable, since the abolition of  slavery, to be distracted by sectional dissensions.  The States  that seceded will soon, in some way, be restored to their rights  and franchises in the Union, forming not the least patriotic  portion of the American people; the negro question will be  settled, or settle itself, as is most likely, by the melting away  of the negro population before the influx of white laborers; all  traces of the 438               late contest in a very few years will be wiped out,  the national debt paid, or greatly reduced, and the prosperity  and strength of the Republic be greater than ever.  Its moral  force will sweep away every imperial throne on the continent,  without any effort or action on the part of the government.   There can be no stable government in Mexico till every trace of  the ecclesiastical policy established by the Council of the  Indies is obliterated, and the church placed there on the same  footing as in the United States; and that can hardly be done  without annexation.  Maximilian cannot divest the church of her  temporal possessions and place Protestants and Catholics on the  same footing, without offending the present church party and  deeply injuring religion, and that too without winning the  confidence of the republican party.  In all Spanish and  Portuguese America the relations between the church and state are  abnormal, and exceedingly hurtful to both.  Religion is in a  wretched condition, and politics in a worse condition still.   There is no effectual remedy for either but in religious freedom,  now impracticable, and to be rendered practicable by no European  intervention, for that subjects religion to the state, the very  source of the evils that now exist, instead of 439                                                emancipating it  from the state, and leaving it to act according to its own  constitution and laws, as under the American system.

But the American people need not trouble themselves about their  exterior expansion.  That will come of itself as fast as  desirable.  Let them devote their attention to their internal  destiny, to the realization of their mission within, and they  will gradually see the Whole continent coming under their system,  forming one grand nation, a really catholic nation, great,  glorious, and free.


THE END.
